- Ages
	- The Age of the Many
	- The Age of the Few
	- The Endless Day
- The Long Ago
	- For years innumerable, the people of Nerah suffered but persevered.
	- Day and night, an endless cycle of sunrise and sunset.
	- The nights ruled by a darkness that crawled with unspeakable danger.
	- For most sentient beings, days were spent preparing for the relentless terrors of the night.
	- But a few learned how to harness the powers of the dark - and speak with the myriad beings that roamed there.
	- The world seemed beyond repair. One by one, the attention of Nerah’s many gods turned to other worlds.
	- Eventually, two archfey rose - a pair bound in a continual chain of death and rebirth.
	- They yearned to put an end to Nerah’s endless suffering.
	- These archfey convinced one of the few gods that remained - a god of chaos - that Nerah was indeed beyond saving.
	- The archfey asked the god to leave the task of rebuilding Nerah to them.
	- The plan they detailed acted on a planetary scale: the god would sunder nearly everything and stop the world’s rotation.
	- The archfey would protect a chosen few and send them into a slumber that would last millenia.
	- When Nerah was purged of the evil behind the darkness, those chosen few would awaken and live in the light of the Endless Day.
	- The god of chaos agreed, and the plan moved forward.
	- But something went wrong.
	- A kernel of the darkness remained, and over time it grew - to a strength beyond what any generation had ever known.
	- Alerted to the strength of this dark power, the attention of the gods has turned back to Nerah.
	- And now one god has decided it knows the only way to stop the darkness that grows in the Night Quarter.
	- This god aims to return Nerah to its natural state, turning endlessly through light and dark, restoring balance to a chaotic and difficult world.

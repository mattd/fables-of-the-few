Oglazath -

Tell Saiviel to keep faith. The Graft of Bricciu does not want to hide. It wants to be known. Akio believed he was clever - but he and five of his order are dead now because of me. That has to count for something.

What the graft contains - we will end it. You have my word. Saiviel has my word.

I will correct the mistake. I will blot out what they know. It is close, and Ioun is powerless to stop me.

Praise Saiviel, Second-Of-The-Name. And praise Saiviel, soon to be returned.

The end of history is near. Praise.

Loâ€™Thos

Zaida, bearer of the Graft of Briccriu, is safe … for now. Huldar, Mayvra, Karna, and Sameera have  rescued her from Wyrfall, protected her from the Twilight Mendicants, kept her from the collective eye of the Woken Ones, and steered her clear of Lo’Thos, the Corrector, servant of both Saiviel, Second- and Saiviel, First-Of-The-Name.

These five trail Yuska Rei, The Guide - last of the Circle of Six - and approach Evangelion, worldly home of the Hope of Ioun. They have returned.

But why?

A promise, one sealed by a curse, lays heavy on our heroes. Six of the seven Blades of the Silver Sun, objects already known to Karna and Sameera, and which together act as key to the Adjuration Flare - are already held by Saiviel. And now Huldar, Mayvra, Karna, and Sameera have vowed to bring a being they know almost nothing about an object which they desire above all else.

Lo’Thos, an agent of night, still roams free - and his dark commander seems unspeakably close to their goal. How will our heroes - and how will the Hope - respond?

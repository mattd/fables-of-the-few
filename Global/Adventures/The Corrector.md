Sixty thousand years have passed since an unimaginable arcane force decimated Nerah - a near-extinction level event that left few survivors. Legend says that a Long Sleep followed, and when the survivors woke - just eight generations ago - they passed on precious little to their children. Those children have only ever known Nerah this way - a transformed, undeniably alien land, littered with indecipherable remnants of a prior age.

For as long as anyone now living can remember, Midsommar - the cradle of Nerah's scattered, fractured civilization - has bathed in a shifting but perpetual daylight. “Nights” of soft dusk flow into brilliant dawns and even longer "days" that seem to never end. But even in the light, unspeakable terrors abound - some hunting freely in the open of the wilds, others waiting patiently to emerge from deep burrows.

And now a rumor spreads: aged seers have suddenly appeared - and speak in long dead tongues of a “turning” that can no longer be undone.

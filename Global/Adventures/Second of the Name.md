Plural and yet one, born recently but wisened with age, Sentience/Mayvra carries with them hints of a vast history. Many millennia, filled with both brilliant hopes and dark horrors.

There, tucked among the countless, layered years, are the slight and slant memories of a whisper. A name: Saiviel. Long ago titled Worldkeeper by the gods themselves, Saiviel again walks in the open. He seeks the relic - one part of seven - on which the very fate of Nerah may turn.

Following their stunning and hard-won victory against the Archdruid Quan, Karna, Sameera, Huldar, and Sentience/Mayvra prepare for a journey that now feels inevitable. They have learned much of their world, and artfully navigated conflict with powerful adversaries - monsters and demons and devotees to an aloof, bookish god.

The stories of those adversaries continue, many of them spinning out towards the darkness at the edge of the world. But these four heroes walk south, for now staying in the light. Towards Saiviel, with key in hand, to either stop or welcome a returning god.

And in the quiet before this new chapter begins, a fey wonder - the bearer of the Graft of Briccriu - calls out in panic for her friend.

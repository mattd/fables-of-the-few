	- Mayvra is from an Alexandria-esque (e.g. Walking Dead) community that was prosperous and started to let their guard down.
	- They were haven for an Order, increasingly disconnected from reality, that believed it was possible to live safely in the open.

	- In fact: Mayvra is a mother, and her daughter died.

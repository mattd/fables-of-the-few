Welcome, Adventurers, to the Discord home for Fables of the Few!

In the event we don’t play in person, we’ll use Discord’s video chat, coupled with a customized FoundryVTT instance, for online play. I’ve also setup the following text channels here:

- \#announcements - This channel. Posted to by the DM only. Mostly time/date announcements about upcoming sessions.
- \#character-building - Meant primarily for discussion about character builds and level-up decisions. You and the wizard both eyeing Fireball as your next AOE go-to? Hash it out here.
- \#in-character - Wrap up loose threads from in-session play here. Third-person narrate simple events - or have protracted drawn out in-character conversations alone or as a group.
- \#lounge - General chat. Anything goes.
- \#theories - Players make guesses about twists and lore drops. DM isn’t allowed to comment, and can only react to theories using the 👀 emoji.
- Adventure specific channels will collect session wrap up notes. Posted to by the DM only.

The Midsommar Lands await!

I’ve setup a campaign on D&D Beyond for our game! DDB is the official digital toolset for D&D 5e, and allows me to share books I’ve purchased on the platform with folks that join a campaign. It also boasts the best, most comprehensive digital character sheet on the market.

[https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/3159518494507418](https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/3159518494507418)

On the campaign page, you’ll find “character sheet stubs” for each of you (Christine’s Character, Rasa’s Character, and Tucker’s Character). Once there - and after you’ve got your DDB account set up (it’s free for you) - just click on the “Claim” link on the appropriate sheet. I’ve made no character selections for you - I’ve only configured campaign level settings so we’re all starting from the same spot.

Have fun!

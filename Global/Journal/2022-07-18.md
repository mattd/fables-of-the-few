Hey! So: I mentioned the potentiality I might someday ask you about this way long ago, but I never followed up because it was purely hypothetical at the time. But now it’s not!

It’s looking pretty certain I’ll be starting up a D&D game with Tucker and Rasa, most likely kicking off late August or early September. Would you have any interest in joining? I think it’d be a BLAST if you did. At the same time, I have zero expectations that you’d be even remotely interested - so no pressure, explicit or implied.

### Welcome to the World of Nerah and the Midsommar Lands!

- This is our world to collaboratively live in and build.
## Introductions!

- Seriously? Kinda.
- How about we chat about our previous RPG experiences?
### Why We‚Äôre Here

- What is Session 0?
   - Talking about the kind of game we collectively want to play.
   - Operational stuff.
### The Campaign Hook

- The hook can morph and change, but we start with one to help you situate your character in the world.
- Our starting hook is: ***Uncover the lost secrets of the Age of Many.***
### Seven Truths of the World

- Sixty thousand years have passed since an unimaginable arcane force decimated Nerah - a near-extinction level event that left few survivors.
- After a Long Sleep that lasted for millennia, the few that survived woke and introduced their children to a transformed land, littered with indecipherable remnants of the prior age.
- Nerah is nearing the end of the 8th generation since the Awakening, and the Midsommar Lands are, consequently, still sparsely populated; dense cities are separated by wide expanses of unsettled land crossed only by the very bravest of souls.
- For as long as anyone can remember, Midsommar has been a land of shifting but perpetual daylight; ‚Äúnights‚Äù of soft dusk flow into brilliant dawns and even longer "days" that seem to never end.
- Few have ever attempted to journey to the Night‚Äôs Quarter, the side of Nerah turned forever from the sun, cloaked in unending darkness.
- Even in the light, unspeakable terrors abound - some hunting freely in the open of the wilds, others waiting patiently to emerge from deep burrows.
- And now a rumor spreads: aged seers have suddenly appeared - and speak in long dead tongues of a ‚Äúturning‚Äù that can no longer be undone.
### Where We Start

- We begin in the small town of Wyrfall, due south - and across the Wyr River - from the city of Il Ausper.
- Wyrfall was once an annex of the larger city of Il Ausper, and acted as its ‚Äúcenter of resources‚Äù.
- A schism recently split the two communities.
- Wyrfall has fallen on hard times. They‚Äôre not a slum, nor are they destitute - but the mood is dark.
- In this world, size means safety and protection.

### What Do You Like Most About RPGs?

### A Few Words About Maps

### What Kind of Magic Items Do You Like Best?

- Wands

- Buffs
- Quirky Tools
- Others?
### My Recommendations and Requests

- Build characters with a clear reason to adventure with the rest of the party.
- Find ways to expose your characters inner world to the rest of the table.
- Have an achievable, simple signature move at Level 1.
- For the first sessions, talk through the math of your rolls.
- I know the rules *pretty* well, but I am not a Rules Lawyer.
### A Social Contract

- I find myself - surprisingly? - liking the social contract D&D publisher Wizards of the Coast put in a recent rules supplement:
	- You will respect the players by running a game that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. You will allow every player to contribute to the ongoing story and give every character moments to shine. When a player is talking, you are listening.
	- The players will respect you and the effort it takes to create a fun game for everyone. The players will allow you to direct the campaign, arbitrate the rules, and settle arguments. When you are talking, the players are listening.
	- The players will respect one another, listen to one another, support one another, and do their utmost to preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party.
	- Should you or a player disrespect each other or violate the social contract in some other way, the group may dismiss that person from the table.

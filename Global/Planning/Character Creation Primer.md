#### Campaign Hook
Uncover the lost secrets of the Age of Many.
#### Seven Truths of the World
1. Sixty thousand years have passed since an unimaginable arcane force decimated Nerah - a near-extinction level event that left few survivors.
2. After a Long Sleep that lasted for millennia, the few that survived woke and introduced their children to a transformed land, littered with indecipherable remnants of the prior age.
3. Nerah is nearing the end of the 8th generation since the Awakening, and the Midsommar Lands are, consequently, still sparsely populated; dense cities are separated by wide expanses of unsettled land crossed only by the very bravest of souls.
4. For as long as anyone can remember, Midsommar has been a land of shifting but perpetual daylight; “nights” of soft dusk flow into brilliant dawns and even longer "days" that seem to never end.
5. Few have ever attempted to journey to the Night’s Quarter, the side of Nerah turned forever from the sun, cloaked in unending darkness.
6. Even in the light, unspeakable terrors abound - some hunting freely in the open of the wilds, others waiting patiently to emerge from deep burrows.
7. And now a rumor spreads: aged seers have suddenly appeared - and speak in long dead tongues of a “turning” that can no longer be undone.

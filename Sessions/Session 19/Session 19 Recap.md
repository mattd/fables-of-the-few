Working from a dimly lit and makeshift workshop in a room beneath the base of the Weaver’s Wend, Huldar crafted a series of arcane tools for himself and his friends. An intricate rune carved through the use of careful magic on a mace he had long carried. For Sentience/Mayvra, a set of bronze bull pendants, granting strength - a reminder of who they once were … or still are? Huldar was excited to see what this new friend could become. But other work - more delicate, worked not in metal but in stone - proved more difficult. As Huldar’s fingers slipped while working a small chunk of jade, a sound of a brief scuffle caught his ear.

Its source? Brinni waking - and immediately confronting Sameera about the nature of her stay here. Was she a prisoner? Sameera assured Brinni that she was free to leave whenever she liked. But what was this about Meerabai, Sameera’s mother? Brinni confrimed: she knew *precisely* where Meerabai stayed - in Cay Abrill, with the Conventicle of the First World, the group that Brinni leads. Somewhat defiantly, Brinni begged off to wander the Wend and find her personal effects. As Huldar climbed the stairs, his tall, imposing form coming into view from an adjacent room, he called loudly to Karna and Sentience/Mayvra, all while Sameera was left with thoughts of a parent she’d barely known.

The four caught up quickly. Brinni was not combative, but *boy* had she dropped a bomb. She returned fully decked out, rings covering her hands, and curious about what the group had done with the Archdruid Quan’s spectacular horde. Brinni’s words practically *dripped* with condescension, and she lowered herself gracefully to floor, unrolling a matte of too-nice camp food. Every bite felt like a flex. And it only took minutes for her goals to become obvious. Whatever it was that the Archdruid had taken from the Conventicle, Brinni wanted it back - and badly. She used every lever that seemed available to her in the moment - Sameera’s desire to know more of her mother, Karna’s penchant for negotiation and his thirst for revenge, Huldar’s deep well of support for his friends. One opportunity she most definitely missed - Sentience/Mayvra’s straightforward honesty.

The other three, though - they were drawn in. Whether they realized it in the moment or not, they gave Brinni much of what she wanted. Confirmation that they had held this seventh Blade of the Silver Sun recently, that Oglazath - a demon - was involved. That they were bound by curse to - *if* and when they found it - bring the relic to Saiviel directly. When Brinni left for some time to forage for a dinner she would cook with Karna, the group shared their unease. Huldar encouraged Sameera - “I would see my parents if I could.” Karna warned of the danger that loomed - “The last time one of these blades was involved, a lot of people died.”

In their end, the group’s talk with Brinni was a slow motion negotiation. Over the dinner preparation they shared, Brinni offered important details. Quan didn’t just take the Blade. He took Brinni herself, believing that she and the Conventicle had discovered some deep truth that the Blades could unlock. But as it turned out, Quan was mistaken. The Conventicle wanted leverage over Saiviel. They had come to understand that Saiviel was - far and away - the most powerful being on Nerah. They know he wants the Blade and intend to use it as leverage - a bargaining chip to convince Saiviel to send everyone still alive on Nerah to the place where everything began - the seat of creation, a different plane, the First World.

But the four heroes didn’t exactly reciprocate - opting instead to conceal their true aims. And Brinni began to lose patience. Huldar in particular was stumbling over his words, searching for an explanation that made sense. As Brinni registered her disappointment, apparently preparing to leave, the group checked in with each other … and a consensus began to gel. For better or worse, they are *of this world*. As Sentience/Mayvra put it, “I just got here.” “But you’ve *been* here,” Huldar retorted. “That was different,” they replied.

Karna made a last go at it. They all did, maybe not trying to convince Brinni to come with them, but offering up a sliver of an aspect of the truth - that they were headed to the Arrid Callum, the Adjuration Flare. With the sun setting behind her, silhouetting her elven form, Brinni quipped back with some kind of veiled threat … again, dripping with condescension - the Conventicle are skilled, formidable. They have a plan, some bit of knowledge Brinni believes only they possess. Yet that hardly matters now, as she turns and walks resolutely away.

And from within, a frightened voice of an alabaster skinned fey, just awoken. A pleading call. “MAYVRA!”

We began bathed in a strobe of iridescent light, the manifestation of synapses forming. Where there was once only Mayvra, now there was a plural, more than just “I”. A new being, Sentience/Mayvra - for lack of a more suitable name - felt, in their first moments, a sense of … peace? Acceptance of facts that they already understood. This was a feeling that - I dare say - Mayvra may have never experienced, at least not in recent years. A sense that things … just “were” and “fit”. And then - with a crack of light - this new being *was*. Before them was Mayvra’s god, a storming maelstrom cloaked and contained at this moment in the form of a myceloid. Kord, the Storm Lord, knelt in front of Sentience/Mayvra, an oddly aged Zaida behind and to one side - obviously bearing a complex weave of emotions. And on the other side, Saiviel Second-Of-The-Name. Saiviel is *furious* to hear how near Kord is to Nerah. They had a *deal*, Saiviel complained. And as this space in between lives crumbled, there were final words from the Storm Lord: “Protect the Waypoint, my child. Without it, I am lost to this world.”

And then Sentience/Mayvra awoke. Sameera ran to gather the others, leaving Pref to introduce himself - and marvel at this new being’s duality. Mayvra is smaller now, but *strong*. Reassured by Sentience/Mayvra’s mode of being, Pref looked frantic. He could leave *now* - and spare a lot of hurt, he figured. “If you need to live another way,” Sentience/Mayvra said calmly, “you can go.” And at that, Pref *bawled*. Completely lost it. And then the moment passed, and the group cycled into the room. Farewells were inevitable. But first, a welcoming. Sameera and Karna seemed both to hold the same kind of reverence for their new/old plural friend. But Huldar, finding Sentience/Mayvra last, seemed to just *get* what they were all about intuitively.

After the Sentience tower fell, Pref had guided the group here - a kind of palatial but largely empty safehouse maintained by the Dawn Walkers. In this sparse infirmary, light filtering in through cream-pink, strangely porous walls, Zaida and Brinni Stonesoul recuperated, Pref having done all that he could to heal them. They would wake in time. With all accounted for, conversation turned to what the group had accomplished - and the overall state of the world. Through a static-y interference that hid the Dawn Walker’s secrets, Pref made it clear he had been called west to the Night’s Quarter. And it was at this point that a realization struck Pref. Sentience had *millenia* of context on this world - and together, as the two of them told stories in pieces, a narrative evolved - with many blank spots now newly filled.

Saiviel Second-Of-The-Name is known also as Nerah’s Worldkeeper. Many thousands of years ago, a darkness was born on this world. Sentience was aware of it, having been initially formed at some point before that birth. The gods were ready to leave the planet, intending to let the darkness win out, consume all, and then wither and die in the vastness of empty space. But Saiviel First-Of-The-Name brokered a deal. Knowing the gods had already given up hope - but believing deeply in the planet’s promise - Saiviel asked for aid in stopping Nerah’s rotation and decimating all but a small pocket of protected life. He would care for the lands in light and quarantine whatever remained in the well-scorched dark, lest some errant bits of evil remained. He convinced the gods, somehow, that what evil was left was best confronted where the light couldn’t touch. While he worked, while the world healed, those few that he had protected, those that survived great terror would sleep until all was clear. But, quite obviously, *something* interfered.

In this present day, whatever darkness grows does so swiftly. And this is where Pref muses openly. Many guesses now confirmed by both what the group has told him about their quest for the blade - and Sentience/Mayvra’s added context - highlight unanswered questions. Saiviel Worldkeeper seeks for the Blades of the Silver Sun, keys to the Adjuration Flare, used to call the gods back to this world. Why would Saiviel *want* the gods to return? If Saiviel was a bad actor, wouldn’t he, more sensibly, want to *keep* that from happening? Wouldn’t he rather *destroy* the Flare? But why, then, would he need the keys? And where *was* First-Of-The-Name? Where had they gone? Would they return?

Everything on Nerah is moving faster now, rushing to some dark end. As Sentience/Mayvra tested the operation of their new body, all cartwheels and exaggerated walks, Pref said his goodbyes. He and Huldar repositioned venting of an arcane forge in the sub-basement. Pref passed Huldar the keys to this house, and explained that there were others, drawing their locations out on a map. Pref had seen Huldar’s kind soul - a fact underscored when Huldar, touched by the realization that Dawn Walker safehouses were engineered to house those that remained at the end, forged a steel horse to sit quietly in a room stocked at first with only a single meager toy. For Sameera, Pref had encouragement - and the gift of context that would echo only after he left - knowledge of the Conventicle of the First World, a cult in Cay Abrill that believes Saiviel intends to return us all to the plane where all life began. Pref picked herbs with Karna, and introduced the aging warrior to the barest glimmer of the stars. Pref implored Karna to embrace his gifts, ready himself for the battles that remain. Pref claims Karna is more capable and mighty than he assumes. Karna’s friends will need it.

And for Sentience/Mayvra, there was wonder - Pref’s instinct that something had changed, that maybe *this* being’s very existence - it’s uniqueness, a duality that mirrored aspects of Nerah’s story itself - maybe this was a turning of the tide. One could hope.

And then Pref was gone. Days passed, and as Sameera returned from archery drills, she found Brinni Stonesoul still asleep but breathing swiftly. Sameera approached, perhaps panicking, and as she laid a hand on Brinni’s sternum, Brinni awoke suddenly, and deftly grappled Sameera by one arm. Sameera’s earnest expression won a brief moment of trust. Brinni rapidly pelted Sameera with questions, but Sameera - wisely - stopped *just* short of telling Brinni of the Blade of the Silver Sun. Yet there was a look on Brinni’s face. “Sameera?” she asked, eliciting a nod. “Meerabai?” And Brinni froze, drawing only the slightest of breaths. “Yes,” Sameera continued. “She was my mother.”

“*Was*, my kindred darling?” A slight smile crossed Brinni’s face. “Meerabai is with us still. With the Conventicle. Meerabai is, in fact, very much alive.”

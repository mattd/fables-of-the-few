	- Huldar tried to loot the Owlbears.
	- Pref telling them more about where Quan came from.
	- Zaida talking about eating the mushroom men.
	- Huldar trying to make Zaida a mushroom treat. “I know what you’re trying to do. It’s very nice of you. But I’ve had mushrooms before. Just not *these* mushrooms.”
	- Saying to Mayvra. If I lick the mushroom guy, will you do it with me. I think this is a “dare” or something.

A thin trickle of blood coursed from Dawn Walker Pref Patar’s nose as he introduced Mayvra, Huldar, Karna, Sameera, and Zaida to two brilliantly colored, mute-but-humming myceloids he had charmed. There was little time for pleasantries. Pref barely had a hold on these new friends of his, and with the sun dropping in the south, time was short. Huldar, naturally, held back to loot the owlbears - maybe hoping to find keys to the Hope of Ioun’s floating fortress or something. But no, Pref was *serious*, and soon Huldar was hustling to catch up. After an hour of travel, the group came to a rise in the windswept plains, and Pref offered options. He pointed to the edge of the Sombrewood - a forest draped in deep shadow. Pref wouldn’t normally dare to suggest taking refuge in this *particular* wood. But then he motioned to the immense, organic, and brilliantly colored towers to the south. The Archdruid Quan is there - and he watches. He is powerful. And Pref - as of yet - has no plan.

So the group set off for the forest’s edge, Karna displaying a distinct and sudden interest in the details of Quan’s history. Pref was frazzled by the effort to maintain control of the Myceloids, their long, loping strides keeping pace along the group’s own. So at this moment, he sounded overwhelmed - and maybe a touch guilty as he shared more details that he’d gathered. From what Pref had recently learned, Oristivius Quan is - to put it in the simplest terms - an escaped prisoner. As it turns out, the Sombrewood is home to a naturally occurring portal to the Shadow Plane - and as Sameera and Karna dig more - Who put Quan there? What held him? What’s the plan for putting him back? - the tension in Pref’s voice rises. He answers questions with questions? Like a guy pushed to the limit? At the end of the day? He needs some sleep.

The group arrived at the Sombrewood’s edge, and found a forest devoid of underbrush - but also one that is preternaturally dense. There is, indeed, an unseeable darkness within. They also notice the forest grows on ground that slopes down and in - like a massive, healed-over crater. Camp was made at a copse some seventy feet from the forest’s edge. Once folks were settled in, Zaida sat cross legged on the ground, opposite one of the group’s two myceloid captives. This guy looked *tasty*. Zaida’s voice and manner of speaking sounded more assured, more developed, and she let everyone know she wanted to *eat* this guy. One bite. She stopped *just* short of daring Mayvra to join her in licking the bigger of the two myceloids. Mayvra was firm in her rebuff. There was maybe a *tiny* bit of mom vibes. Huldar foraged, failed, and then prestidigitated a piece of hard tack into something vaguely mushroom flavored. Zaida appreciated the effort.

That night, Karna took first watch, his eyes scanning the strange inky darkness of the Sombrewood. Sure enough, something lurked within. Something small. A goblin with blue-green skin, draped in layered robes. She was cautious, skittery, a hand crossbow held tightly in shaking hands. Somehow, Karna calmed her down a bit - but then Mayvra woke. A *minotaur* - something Gehrp had never seen. Sameera, then Zaida, also woke. Huldar and Pref just snored. That the group made friends with this small one, it all hinged on the name of that Archdruid - Quan. Gehrp explained that she was a member of a coven with a simple name: the Gate Watchers. They, too, hope to gain leverage on Quan and force him to return to his prison on the Shadow Plane. Quan is *powerful* - and though Gehrp felt it was probably unlikely that the Gate Watchers would choose to align themselves with relative strangers, she liked this group. Maybe she could talk “the others” into … something. She didn’t know what. Who were those others? Mayvra caught sight of something just beyond the tree line. Something massive. Gehrp yelped, and stood to take leave and join her brother. Just as Huldar woke, Gehrp’s body rippled, expanded, transformed into something larger, bestial, utterly feral. A barghast. She deeply growled her thanks - and a promise she would explain all this to her kin. Then Gehrp galloped into the wood to join a much larger fiend, barely observed in the shadows.

The next morning, Pref felt much better - perky even. Your way turned marshy. That marsh got deeper, broad trunked trees got taller. And through a break in the trees, Mayvra got a clear look at one of the myceloid towers. Massive, hundreds of feet tall, orb-like protrusions that glowed with a shifting hue. And clear as day, Mayvra saw the tower *turn*, as if considering you. This was news to Pref. And only minutes later, there was even worse news. As the group struggled through deeper swamps, climbing over root structures thicker than a mountain dwarf, Pref held up a hand. Then, all around you, Myceloids peeled off from the trunks of trees - the largest, an elder - easily 15 feet in height. Pref whistled and gestured in the air, and the two charmed Myceloids surged forward, tackled two of their kin and disappeared beneath the water.

What followed was chaos. One myceloid surged into the pack, and large pocks in the creatures flesh opened, filling the air with noxious spores. *Everyone* resisted this. And what’s more, this group has learned *to fight*. Sameera ducked behind cover, and as her arrow found its mark, Zaida tucked in beside. “You’re very good at what you do,” Zaida chimed. Karna’s glaive swung with exacting precision, while Huldar sidled up, blessing the warrior’s blade. Both took massive hits - and kept swinging. And Mayvra, at first unsteady, felt a coiled up fury unraveling. She thrust her palm into one Myceloid’s chest and the taut wire of a summer storm unraveled against it, its porous flesh crisping to black. Mayvra pulled back, her hand faintly glowing. This fight wasn’t finished.

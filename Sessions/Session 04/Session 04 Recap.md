Huldar, Mayvra, Karna, and Sameera sat in a comfortable, sun-soaked room in the Dusk Meadow Inn. The pair to a Sending Stone held by Yuska Rei - otherwise known as “The Guide” - landed quietly in Sameera's palm. Yuska's words still rang in Sameera's head. The choice seemed binary: head west to the Farhaven Ruin and investigate the alleged hideout of the Scions of Lo'Thos - or head north in pursuit of Yuska as she hurried to meet the Hope of Ioun, recently returned from some long absence. Perhaps believing that some terrible momentum was building, the group decided that time was of the essence - they would leave Il Ausper quickly and run headlong *towards* the enemy at Farhaven.

But before they left, Huldar wanted to make sure his mentor Thenolin was apprised of his situation. The group was en route, headed through the streets of Palebroak, when a pall fell over the curving streets. A strange owl cloaked in darkness - one of the same that assaulted Mia the previous night - passed over a strip of sky that cut between the rooftops. Zaida panicked, saying, "The Graft. They seek it. I am the reason they are here." Then: "HIDE." Dutifully, Huldar conjured an illusory cart to hide behind. The owl passed, and when they advanced minutes later, a second owl overhead failed to notice their presence. But then the group's luck ran out. As they sprinted for the border of Brynn Gardens, a third owl clocked their position. It swooped to the ground, considered each quizically, and then dropped its druidic form. Standing in the owl's place was a fey figure robed in a semi-corporeal cloak that seemed to shift of its own accord. "You have something he wants," she hissed. "Where are you hiding it?" And then her eyes locked on Zaida.

Showing true bravery, all four sprung to Zaida's defense. Huldar called on Moradin, a bronze light warding your fey friend. Then a plasma-like ribbon of lightning shot from Mayvra's hands, wrapping the mendicant and pulling her off balance. Sameera nocked an arrow and struck true, a thick black smoke pouring from the wound. The mendicant lunged towards Zaida, metal claws grasping - but Karna stopped her in her tracks. Furious, the mendicant scowled and took the form of an owl once more, reeling upwards. Karna's glaive struck her from the air - a look of failure on her strange fey face before Karna plunged his glaive into the prone figure's chest, scattering her as smoke on the breeze.

Arriving in the strange wilds on the western side of Brynn Gardens, Huldar waltzed straight into the home and workshop of his mentor, Thenolin. The vibe was all, "You brought *people* here?" and when Mayvra awkwardly extended her hand, Thenolin commiserated. "I feel you. Huldar doesn't always think before he acts - I'm not prepared for this myself." But Thenolin was warm, too. Zaida in particular - childlike, as she is - triggered some small joy in her. But Thenolin is also a bit of a recluse, and she was surprised by news of the destruction of Wyrfall and the Grey Guard. She sensed that Huldar may be in over his head and asked Mayvra - who has already saved her pupil once - to watch after him. As the group started to leave, Thenolin lead Huldar to a corner of her workshop, where she drew forth a strange hammer crafted of dark metals. Verragen the Wanderer was said to have brought this from the edge of the Night's Quarter. "I don't know why I'm telling you this, but if something happens to me … " And Huldar chimed in to finish her thought, "Then I should get rid of it?" Thenolin considered this for a moment, before telling Huldar simply that she couldn't give up the hammer - not quite yet.

An uneasy mood hung in the air as the group headed to the North Gate docks, where they hired an arcane tug to guide their fishing boat away from the pull of the Void Whorl. In a matter of hours, you were on the shores of the mainland once more, hiking through what looked like massive, scored tracks, stepped earthen paths lined with rock shard rubble. Everyone but Mayvra clocked a blur of blue-green fur dodging just out of view. As the group snuck forward, two Troglodytes closed in behind, and a massive Quaggoth strode forward, emboldened. Then its voice flooded the minds of everyone present. “Long have we suffered under the light of the nearest star. Soon, it ends. Praise to Saiviel, Second-of-his-Name. They who bring great change. Praise to the beings not bound to this plane. Those that bring with them the true darkness. Praise to Lo’Thos the Corrector."

A flurry of action unfolded in a heartbeat. An icy ray from Mayvra's hands crashed into one Trog, slowing him down, mid-charge towards Huldar. Spinning in the other direction, Mayvra's quarterstaff lit with flame, burning the lizard person's form and dropping it to the ground. Huldar called forth a spectral shield of faith - as he, Sameera, and Zaida piled on the other Trog. And so it was Karna that witnessed the Quaggoth's true nature up close. Arcane strands wrapped the beast, its size expanding. Now standing nearly 15 feet tall, it charged forward, and with a massive arcing strike, Karna stopped the Quaggoth where it stood. All rushed forward. Mayvra, trying to find an opening to charge in with lowered horns, was lifted from the ground by the beast's terrible claws - and then slammed to the ground, near death. In seconds, Huldar had healed her with a divine entreaty. As Karna carved with surgical precision, a mace strike from Huldar wrapped the Quaggoth in a softly thudding energy. Two arrows flew wide of their mark, but then Sameera nocked her longbow once more. As the creature roared at Karna, a single arrow struck the Quaggoth in the back. It sucked in a shallow breath and swayed to the side, its lung punctured. Finally, arms outstretched in a failed attempt to pull Karna to the ground, the Quaggoth fell.

The field went quiet. Adrenaline calmed. And then a small, frustrated huff. Zaida looked at her bow in one hand, an arrow in the other. Frowning wide, Zaida threw her weapons fitfully to the ground and stormed off, feet hammering on the dusty path heading west.

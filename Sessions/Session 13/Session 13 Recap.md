Karna, Sameera, and Zaida looked on as a stocky, many-colored myceloid loosed a thick cloud of spores, entirely enveloping Huldar and Mayvra. Huldar managed to duck out of harm’s way - but Mayvra inhaled deeply, her throat burning with a searing, white-hot pain. Then … a reprieve. She felt fine. Nothing wrong here, for sure. Which was good - because there was a fight that had to be finished.

Myceloids, already ragged, swung massive fists. A maelstrom of electrical energy arc’d from Mayvra’s arms. The whistle of arrows from Sameera and Zaida was followed by the thick thud of targets hit. As weapons spun, Dawn Walker Pref Patar’s ears perked, and the harengon darted through the swamp towards a hunched-over humanoid that collapsed into the wet and glinting ground. One down. Two down. Karna swings as a third tries to escape, slashing it through the torso and causing it to *literally* hold itself together. But a thrown dagger from Huldar hit between the eyes. The myceloid reached up to yank the knife free - and suddenly there were two lifeless myceloid halves in the water, dissolving fast.

In the aftermath, the gravity of the situation became apparent. Mayvra, caught in a vicious coughing fit, expelled a massive wad of pink *something* from her lungs. Karna, who stood nearby had never seen anything like it. Taking stock of her mental state, Mayvra began to realize something had … shifted. She had to *move.* West, quickly. A clicking buzz emanating from the remnants of the myceloids had a meaning to Mayvra, the long equivalent of a single word: join.

But that wasn’t all. The man that Pref had been ministering too was in a *bad* way - shelves of fungal growth on his face and arms, flesh split, his breathing labored. For a moment, his fogged-over gaze cleared, and his eyes passed over the group. They stopped on Sameera. “Meerabai?” he asked aloud. His breathing stopped and a high hiss filled the air. The man’s form split swiftly, rupturing from the inside out - and amidst the carnage was a tiny myceloid spawnling with a strange, piercing cry. Karna, who had been kneeling next to the man, drew his shawl away from his face - and crushed the spawn underfoot without hesitation.

As the six quickly consulted with their resolute minotaur friend, Huldar quietly called on Moradin - and a healing aura encircled all who needed it. Pref kept stride with Mayvra as they moved west, with Zaida - heartbreakingly - keeping a wary, distrustful eye on her friend. It was important, Pref suggested, that everyone know they could trust her. And they could, Mayvra swore. But she worried quietly about whether she could trust her old friends around her … new friends.

Soon, the group found themselves guided up to the dry lip of a crater that encircled a massive myceloid tower. *This* was *it,* Mayvra knew. And more specifically - whatever was at the top, hundreds of feet above. The whole group clocked a disturbing reality - dozens of myceloids of all sizes stood quietly in a wide arc around the tower’s base, waiting for something. Huldar crafted a quite-darling approximation of an illusory myceloid goo baby for Mayvra to play with - all the better to distract her as Huldar and Karna discussed next steps? A diversion, perhaps? But minutes ticked past - and suddenly, a loud, resonant clicking hum filled the air. Mayvra understood this - and was suddenly filled with compassion for their cause. The tribe was moving on Cir Kallan, a town not far to the north. But it wasn’t sure why. The “when” part sure seemed answered, as the crowd moved like a flock, flowing over the west side of the crater. “Welp,” Pref said. “Now’s our chance.”

The party noted opaque veins of a sort just beneath the ground, pulling something towards the tower. Thin fissures revealed something soft beneath the stiff carapace exterior. Bone-like stairs lead through a natural door. Pref gave a small “after you!” bow as Sameera stepped in to assess the risk this … entity might just swallow them whole upon entry. But they weren’t swallowed, and inside, a stair followed a somewhat irregular path up, farther than the light would illuminate. What’s more - there was a strange slow moving bubble pod, adding to the tower’s dim illumination, pulling itself from the ground in a slow motion that approached stillness. Everyone - even Zaida - resisted the urge to pop the thing. Suddenly - soft claws on boney stairs above. Sameera could see a pair of lights, and as she raised a hand to shield her eyes, she saw that this particular light issued from the eyes of a lizard humanoid with opaque skin - and a ghastly row of near-translucent razor teeth. With it was a single companion. The pair scuttled swiftly upward - like scouts … with a message to convey.

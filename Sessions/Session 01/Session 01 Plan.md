	- Session Start
		- [Intro]
			- Welcome - to the World of Nerah.
			- At the start, we soar above the clouds. The light is brilliant, all consuming. And as our eyes adjust, those clouds part, and we fall through them into a dive, the ground rushing up to meet us. We can’t breathe - it’s too much … and then suddenly our flight levels out. Our breath returns.
			- We see a varied landscape - almost preternaturally so by the standards of this world. Lush, damp woods; a sparkling, arrid, desert plateau; undulating hills. The whole land feels alive beneath us.
			- There are also things much older and stranger than anything in our world: a circle of towering monoliths built, presumably, to some long-lost god; a wilderness filled with iridescent pods growing like some foul, corrupted weed of inconceivable size.
			- From the darkness of a cavern’s mouth, we see a grey-blue furred, bipedal beast with two rows of six eyes, and a grin-like mouth filled with double rows of fanged teeth. It sniffs the air as we soar past, high above.
			- And there are ruins - ruins that look older than time. And they are _everywhere_.
		- [Civilization]
			- Roads are few and nearly no one is traveling them. But we do see _some_ adventurous souls. These few are wildly diverse - and they have the look of a people that are driven.
			- But now coming into focus are cities spotting the land - developed bastions, many of them shining and new. Many are far more _modern_ than makes sense given what we know of this world’s past. We soar towards one, and our flight slows. A fortified island in the midst of a wide forked river.
			- And then: we notice a small town to its south. That’s where we’re headed.
			- As we pan in, we see that this small town has an odd shape - three curved arcs of buildings, clearly once ruined and then repaired, then built-on anew. The buildings arranged in these arcs are set close together, as if they were once part of a much more crowded city.
			- And these partial semi-circles, these arcing streets, face a spire built atop a low hill, set away from the rest of the town. It may have once looked threatening - but not now.
		- [Glim’s Home]
			- And now we pull even closer to those arc’d streets, focusing on one building.
			- [Read description of the house.]
			- And someone is just returning - just opening the front door. This … is Mayvra.
	- Scenes
		- Huldar, Mayvra, and Karna convene at Glim’s House for a late breakfast.
		- After noting the strange disappearance of Wyrfall’s Gray Guard, Glim’s House is decimated and chaos breaks out across Wyrfall.
		- Karna’s attention is drawn to a small female child - Zaida under the effects of a Disguise Self spell - huddled in the rubble of a nearby building.
		- Akio Kiran braves Wyrfall’s debris littered streets to reunite with Zaida and rush her towards the Cinder Spire.
		- The group follows Akio and Zaida, now pursued by the Scions’ of Lo’Thos, to the Cinder Spire.
		- Akio is murdered by the Scions, and the group intervenes in an attempt to rescue Zaida.
		- Zaida takes the group to the Graft of Briccriu and becomes the Hope Cipher.
		- Returning to Wyrfall proper, the group investigates, settles business with allies - and eventually decides to either track the Scions to Farhaven Ruin or head to Il Ausper in pursuit of the missing Gray Guard.
	- Secrets & Clues
		- Yesterday evening, the Gray Guard quietly vacated the town of Wyrfall.
		- The Gray Guard were drawn to Il Ausper by a distress call, received by Full Marshal Rone Brightgrave, that followed the assassination of four members of the Circle of Six.
		- The Cinder Spire serves as vault for the Graft of Briccriu - an object lying in wait, ready to fuse with the next incarnation of the Hope Cipher.
		- Akio Kiran, The Devoted has been living quietly in Wyrfall for months, keeping Zaida close to the Graft of Briccriu and waiting for the day she would be prepared to receive it.
		- The White Ravens, a small crew of treasure seekers based out of Il Ausper, encountered what a lone survivor described as a “massive demon” two days southwest of the city.
		- The Scions of Lo’Thos carry six clockwork spheres, each the size of a grapefruit, that can be tuned to disrupt and scatter any material that falls within the tuning’s resonant frequency.
		- The Scions’ clockwork spheres are tuned to the frequency of materials used in most of Wyrfall’s buildings; other buildings across the town sustain surface damage.
		- Evidence suggests the Scions of Lo’Thos coordinated their attack on Wyrfall from the Farhaven Ruin, northeast and across the river from Il Ausper.
		- Wyrfall is built on the ruins of a city that pre-dates the awakening - Dawn’s Gate, a sprawling metropolis that also occupied land south of Wyrfall and north beyond present day Il Ausper.
		- Miali Glim’s ancestors served as sentries for the Hope of Ioun and vowed to protect the Cinder Spire at all costs.

- Resources
	- The Scions’ Arrival
		- Something in the air changes. An electricity - an infinitely small vibration. The hair on the back of your neck stands on end. 
		- Outside on the street, there’s a high pitched, mechanical whine.
		- Then the walls begin to shake.
		- And then everything explodes. A heavy, low crack - like the very center of thunder. It’s as if a detonation has gone off - but you’re right in the middle of it, and somehow you’re able to watch its effects.
		- The walls around you seem to lose form, vaporize into a dense dust - one that for a split second still looks like a building. But then that dust rises, rocketing into the sky in all directions.
		- You blink through the thin cloud of dust that hangs in the air, and you see now that most of the building is gone. There are some parts of the walls that remain - some framing still stands, and a six foot high section of the far corner of Glim’s House is almost entirely intact.
		- And as you look around you see that other buildings around you have similarly been reduced to this strange absence of rubble.
		- Somehow, you are all unharmed.
		- Then you hear another thunderous explosion elsewhere - close by. And now you process the yells. And the screams. And the crying.

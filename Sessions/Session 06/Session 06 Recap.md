Sameera leaned shoulder first through a door of pale gold, a warm-hued, sourceless light flowing out into the dark hall beyond. And then two reptilian heads snapped in her direction. Sameera yelped a quick and quiet warning at Mayvra, Huldar, Karna, and Zaida, then backpedaled through the door, attempting to slam it closed behind her. But the first Troglodyte was quick and strong, knocking Sameera off balance and sending her stumbling back. It was all hands on the bad one, as Mayvra’s staff lit with white flame, Huldar’s sword thrummed with thunderous energy, Sameera nocked an arrow, and Karna readied - for the first time that we’ve seen - an evenly-weighted hand axe that quickly found purchase in one Trog’s shoulder. But as it turned out, it was Zaida’s sword that dropped both Trogs. She wiped their dark, ichorous blood from her blade - and gazed longingly at Sameera’s bow.

Huldar whispered to Mia and she fluttered into the western cavern to keep watch, Karna closing the door behind her as she left. Then Huldar guided the group down a long spiral stair to find at the bottom an L shaped room with vaulted ceilings and unimaginably ancient debris scattered throughout. Evidence of dead fires, maybe a month or two old, were also apparent, marking the floor in wide circles. Huldar sent forward as bait an illusory Jackalope, matching the one you’d seen just hours earlier - and damned if it didn’t work.

A massive ghast leaped for the image of the beast, sprawling out on the floor. Beginning to build some real synergies, Karna and Huldar glance at each other, with Huldar’s mace lighting with radiant flame as he fell in behind the ghast. When the ghast was distracted by Karna’s graceful advance, Huldar struck, and the ghast’s whole form caught fire. Zaida clocked the approach of two Kobolds from the east side of the chamber, and as she and Sameera ran to secure that area, Mayvra flicked her hands towards the ground and was lifted by a sudden gust of wind, twin bursts of ice flying at the kobolds moments before she landed. But Zaida also took a massive hit to the arm, and as she went to steady a shot with her bow, Sameera gently corrected her form, giving Zaida a clear, definitive hit. Mayvra turned to the Ghast that, still burning, had been worn down by Karna and Huldar’s relentless attacks. She drew out her Ykwla … and fumbled the blade, dropping it with a clatter on the stone. The Ghast, dropping to its knees, immolated by radiant flame, gave her a quizzical look before toppling to the side, spent.

Huldar looted, and then gazed through Mia’s eyes, spotting two kobolds inspecting the aftermath of your fight in the cavern above. Of note, Huldar saw one kobold was blindfolded, yet seemingly was still able to see - and noticed the blindfold also seemed to conceal something foreign beneath. Karna checked a collapsed bit of floor, and was unable to make out its bottom. Then, fatefully, Sameera signaled her intention to carefully descend down a steep tunnel to the north and report back. Once there, she found a large cave, the northern part of which had walls almost like a fine-grained black geode - and a kobold, facing away from her. Her breath stilled, years of training clicked into place, and a single arrow soundlessly spun and dropped the kobold to the ground. Emboldened, Sameera snuck towards a narrow passage, walls glinting more brilliantly, and found a kind of long burrow. At its end was a throne or nest of sorts - and digging among bedding was an other-planar being. It picked what an envelope, quickly vanished it, then turned towards her, its thin, wide wings unfurling. “I really wish you wouldn’t.”

But Sameera did.

As Sameera drew her bow, the creature rose on its wings, muttering a sibilant incantation. A sphere of energy grew larger than Sameera. It sparkled with the light of far off galaxies. Then it enveloped her - and she was gone. Minutes passed, and the rest of the group found their way down the steep tunnel, Huldar losing his footing near the bottom. Karna lead, Mayvra close behind - “Where’s Sameera?” There was a pause, as Oglazath cocked his head, marveling at Karna. Oglazath knew this man that charged at him now. “His mind was full of you when I bled him dry,” he said. “You … and the Blade.” All piled on - except for Mayvra, who struggled for words, then buried her face in her hands. Slowly, it dawned on all four that this creature didn’t want to fight - and dropping him could mean losing Sameera. Sameera meanwhile floated through what felt like endless space - and discovered she could move through the use of her mind. But where was this? And how could she leave?

Karna wants to know *why* - and eventually Oglazath finds some level of comfort, some knowledge - perhaps - that he’s the one in control. He didn’t want to *kill* Fynn, he tells Karna. He’s … sorry, even. But the Blades of the Silver Sun - the one Karna and Fynn were commissioned to steal - well, Saiviel needs these. They are, after all, the keys to the Adjuration Flare, a kind of beacon meant to call the gods to Nerah. Saiviel wishes to gather all of the Blades, dismantle the Flare, and - presumably - prevent the return of the gods. Lo’Thos also works for Saiviel, but - Oglazath adds cryptically - Lo’Thos “trusts both of their faces equally - and *that* is a mistake.” Today, Oglazath is a messenger. He flashes the letter. Lo’Thos does not to wish to speak with Saiviel directly. He shoots a wry smile at Zaida, saying, “I can’t imagine why.”

In the end, what the four want now is simple - the return of Sameera. And, in turn, Oglazath wants to know what leverage the group feels they hold. Mayvra, anger building, snarls in response: “Do you think this is it? That it’s just us?” And in that moment - for a brief, second he looks troubled. And then that look is gone. “What can you do for *me*?” he asks. “What *if* I bring her back?” There’s the briefest of pauses before Karna speaks. “What if we help you find the last Blade?”

Silence. Then Oglazath steps closer. “Tell me Karna …” No one breathes. “Do I have your word?”

A massive Quaggoth laid dead, it’s grappling arms still draped over Karna’s feet. Zaida, frustrated by her relative inexperience with the shortbow, stormed down the dusty, rock strewn path, Sameera following at a distance. Mayvra charged after the diminutive fey and, instead of trying to fix anything, just offered her a ride on her shoulders. For a moment, Zaida was still troubled. She *had* to be better - and thumped hard against her chest: “The *whole* world.” But in the end, she took the ride, and - quietly - Sameera resolved to help.

Always the gear monkey, Huldar looted the corpses, and then the group was off. They made their way through rolling hills choked with thick brush, Karna getting ripped to shreds by briars and hungry vines as he looked for a suitable camp. By the time they found a well-tucked clearing, it was already late. Mayvra checked with a latent ability she’d never thought twice about - asking wordlessly, “Were they safe? Is there bad weather coming?” Only Karna saw thin smoke curl from her eyes, and only Mayvra heard the deep, rumbling reassurance: “Rest.” Sameera approached Zaida, who explained with few words that Akio had been good at teaching how to punch and very *bad* at shooting. The two practiced, Sameera patiently correcting Zaida’s form and proferring many tips, but more lessons would be needed. Meanwhile, Mayvra spoke with Karna, asking for some advice on use of the Yklwa. With the way the past two days had gone, it was clear to Mayvra she was gonna need it. With a kind, resolute, and maybe proud demeanor, Karna shared the outlines of his military training. Ultimately, though, it all boiled down to, “You charge in and do the whole pokey pokey.”

Huldar laid out an array of metals, and as his hands lit with divine light, the metal softened and gathered, allowing Huldar to mold it into novel shapes. With this, he fashioned a thin but surprisingly weather proof tent. Mayvra exploded a bonfire, but it was all fine. And shortly later, Mia spiraled up on the breeze, Huldar gazing out through her eyes. Only two miles to the west, finally, was Farhaven - a temple-like ruin built into - or perhaps covered by - a large hill. Huldar saw two kobolds approaching the ruin that seemed entirely unaware of the group’s camp. Huldar also clocked two entrances: a long neglected temple entrance at the top - massive, worn pillars glowing brighter than made logical sense - and a cave entrance lower down into which the kobolds walked. But for now: things were safe. Even a rustle in the brush during Karna’s evening watch turned out to be nothing more than a lone Jackalope. Mayvra, not yet asleep, snuck forward, clicking horns with the “taller than it should be” beast, and began clicking away in an animal tongue Karna couldn’t decipher. It seemed … reassuring for Mayvra. The rest of the night was calm - save for a strange far-off chanting that Huldar heard only during the short stutter-start pre-dawn.

The next morning, the group reflected on what lay ahead. Huldar minor-imaged-up an approximation of the ruin, and Karna posed a very sensible question: are we *really* storming Farhaven? The answer was, in the end, yes - with Zaida maybe the most outwardly excited once she realized it might test her bow skills. Zaida and Sameera *expertly* snuck ahead, and when they reached the dark cave-like entrance the kobolds had taken, Sameera *quickly* picked out a trip wire carefully drawn across the entrance. Yet the place was quiet. By the time the pair had guided the others into the Ruins, the strange, historic pull of this place was evident. Stone walls appeared melted by some ancient force, there were rooms of a temple half-finished, and a small chamber packed with filthy bedrolls, suggesting the group was not alone. Sameera was able to read a prayer of some sort etched on the wall of a rubble-filled prayer room, the name of the temple’s god scratched out. And in the bed chamber, she found the faintly glowing head of a statue meant to depict the face of the divine.

After examining the last of a few foot lockers left from some recent exodus, Huldar heard whispers from an adjacent and partly finished cavern. Karna took the lead in, and the group came face to face with two kobolds and a hideous, undead Ghast, its long tongue lashing wildly at the air. The group worked *quick* - Zaida celebrating a hit with her shortbow coach, Mayvra making expert use of elemental ice, Sameera managing a brutal one-shot, and Karna and Huldar pinning the Ghast against one wall. In the quiet after the fight, the group discovered that they stood in what looked like a depleted mine, which Huldar could tell had a faint necrotic signature.

But here also was a massive, polished door - immaculate, made of polished metal not unlike pale gold. With aid from Huldar and Mayvra, Sameera picked the door’s multi-layered lock - and it gave way with the feel of a vacuum seal opening. Everything here glowed with a divine light. Karna, uncomfortable with this feeling, stood outside the room as the others examined a half dozen representations of what must have been the same god, its name long lost. Huldar briefly left and then returned with the statue Sameera found earlier, and when he attempted to mend the break, he could feel the touch of something that *pulled* on his connection to Moradin - even if Moradin himself was not the source. Mayvra, perhaps looking for some connection to the voice she heard earlier, touched a statue that looked like a stylized storm - but she too could tell: this was something new.

As we closed, our heroes readied themselves to delve deeper. Sameera opened a southern door that lead into a long hallway. Cautiously, she peered out - and suddenly, two reptilian faces spun towards her. Troglodytes. Sentries. Guardians of the Ruins that Lo’Thos the Corrector had recently claimed.

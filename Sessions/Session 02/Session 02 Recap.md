Righteously pissed from a brutal series of stabs to the gut, Mayvra kicked her now-dead attacker, a linen-clad kobold, heavily in the side. The Cinder Spire was quiet and calm, and from one of the three towers, still marveling over Zaida’s absorption of a mysterious orb, Huldar and Karna could hear the “clang … clang clang” of an empty metal orb falling from the kobold’s clothes and rolling across the floor. Mayvra saw the orb had a highly mechanized exterior, and on inspection, Huldar knew - vaguely - that its origin was tied to an order of arcane practitioners in the north. This one was hollow and sported a hole, but a second orb on another kobold was heavier and entirely closed. The group pocketed both. But there was more looting to be done. Up a stair next to a painting of three moons - including a bright blue moon no one’s ever seen - Huldar found and pocketed a carefully hung gold necklace set with a large ruby. In the other tower - above a painting of three stylized eyes set in a triangle - they found some errant coin and a letter in an unfamiliar script, the only trace of common being a salutation that read “Mir Glim”.

On their way out, Huldar looted the kobolds and then weighed the cost-benefit of stealing thousands of pounds of silver curtains, even briefly considering climbing on Mayvra’s ample shoulders to get more height. Instead, he settled on cutting off a small swath. As he was hacking at it, a nimble and frantic looking elf ran breathless into the Spire’s main hall. This, it turned out, was Sameera. While the group tried to contextualize their connections with each other and their locations during the destruction of Wyrfall, Zaida ran up to Sameera and leaped into her arms. Up until now, Sameera knew only of Zaida’s human guise, but she’s glad to see her - and the revelation that these three were now looking after Zaida seemed to encourage some level of trust between Sameera and the rest of you.

The group, sadly, had to inform Sameera that the man she came to find, Akio Kiran, was dead. Sameera explained that Akio was one of the Circle of Six, a group of mystics that work on behalf of a much larger group that Sameera refers to as the Hope of Ioun. Sameera has for a short time worked for the Circle as spy and messenger, and this morning, another of the six - Yuska Rei - came to Sameera in a panic. “Things are moving faster than the Circle ever dreamed,” Yuska said. “Go to Wyrfall and tell Akio the Hope of Ioun has returned. If Akio has read the signs, he will have already gone to the Cinder Spire. Find him there.” Yuska gave Sameera a small stone with a circle of swirling branches on it, telling her Akio would know how to use it.

The five began heading back to town, and Zaida - surprisingly - re-sealed the Cinder Spire with but a glance. The town was in shambles, coated in a thick grey dust. While some parts of Wyrfall’s buildings were vaporized, others still stood, and nearly all personal effects were strangely in tact. Gathering his shop’s weapons stock was Irrun - a capri-sporting bugbear and business associate of Huldar. Irrun was trying to make sense of what happened, and told the four of a group of treasure hunters called the White Ravens. They claimed to have seen a massive demon two days south of Wyrfall. Only one survived, and they’re now home in Il Ausper. Irrun sent his regards to Huldar’s mentor, Thenolin, and the group went in search of - and found - Miali Glim. Karna soon showed her the letter from the Spire - and Miali was *shook* by what she saw. It turns out “Mir” is an antiquated honorific, and Mir Glim refers to her father, Ottavio Glim. This, in fact, is the reason Miali lives in Wyrfall. Years ago, her father worked as a sentry protecting the Cinder Spire, helping the Circle to help protect an “object of great influence” as Ottavio would often refer to it. Miali desperately wanted to know what was actually *in* the Spire, but Karna stopped short of describing the orb. Karna *did* introduce her to Zaida, though, and Miali noted that since Akio moved to Wyrfall quietly several months ago, the human girl she now knows to be Zaida has rarely left his side.

Bidding Miali farewell for now, the group decided to head for Il Ausper. On your way to the docks and the boat Sameera borrowed from Yuska, you ran into a Gray Guardsman. Karna was a bit brusk with the guy, but he had seen your heroic actions, and shared some intel despite the reception. The Guard has a tight relationship with the Circle of Six, and Full Marshall Rone Brightgrave received an urgent summons the night before. *Something* has happened to the Circle. The situation was serious enough to cause the Full Marshall to bring the entire Guard with him, leaving only Agent Gallen in Wyfall. “We were so blind,” he lamented.

This only hardened the group’s resolve. From the Cleftstone Docks, the group piloted the Circle’s fishing boat across the Southern Breakwater. Then Huldar saw it - a dark form on the water. You had only a brief moment to prepare as three boneless, tooth-handed chokers threw themselves onto the deck, attacking with ferocious speed and extraordinary reach. One of the chokers lunged with both arms at Huldar, and he was brought down, bleeding profusely, clinging to life. His friends fought valiantly to protect him. Mayvra, under pressure, reached for the magic she doesn’t fully understand. Karna, a spinning master of the glaive. Mia flitting to the aid of her new companions. Zaida, brandishing a sleek shortsword hidden and strapped to her back, carving expertly at each tentacle in her reach. And Sameera, ducking in the hold, missing her first two longbow shots, and then landing the third with devastating accuracy, ending the battle.

At the end, it was Mayvra that kneeled next to Huldar. In the Breakwater’s stiff wind, her eyes leaked a misty light. This same light issued from her hand as she reached out to touch the worst of Huldar’s wounds. Though not healed, the bleeding ceased, and the Firbolg woke. Mayvra nodded. “I’m as confused as you are.”

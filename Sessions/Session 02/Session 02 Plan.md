	- Recap
		- As we begin, Mayvra, the cable-knit-sweater-sporting Minotaur is just returning to Glim’s House from a brief errand. The smell of frying spices is strong in the air, and as she struggles to close the door behind her, Mayvra finds Karna playing sous chef on some root vegetables for the proprietor of the House, the chestnut skinned and (literally) golden haired Miali Glim. Karna can’t cook - but he _sure_ is fast with a knife. Mayvra, it turns out, wasn’t able to find what Miali sent her for, and she’s deeply, anxiously apologetic - but Miali assures her she understands. Then down the stairs comes the still-sleep-fogged Huldar. He returned to Glim’s House late last night from a trip to nearby Il Ausper, and Miali seems a bit concerned.
		- While cooking, Miali pauses to reflect on the morning. She mentions a suspicious absence of Wyrfall’s security force, the Gray Guard, from the streets. Huldar shared that, when returning last night, he saw at least one such guard leaving town via the docks. Maybe to calm Miali, Huldar conjured his owl familiar, Mia, to fly a circle around Wyrfall and see if anything’s up - but everything looked fine. Karna made a pass too, avoiding interaction with an older man that waved skeptically as he passed. Miali shared with the group how good it was to have some rooms full - she clearly feels some bond with this set. Meanwhile, Huldar introduces Mayvra to Mia, and Mayvra is enamored - if still distrustful of Huldar. “I’m not okay!” Mayvra exclaimed openly. Among other things, her yklwa is broken, and Huldar delivers a mesmerizing mending spell through Mia. The yklwa is fixed, and Mayvra now has a new owl friend. Miali turns to Karna and - putting trust in him at a level maybe even _he_ doesn’t fully understand - asks him to stay close to these two. Karna nods in understanding.
		- After breakfast, the air changed. A buzz. A whine. And then a _massive_ explosion. Though - oddly - no one was injured by the debris, most of the town’s building’s were simply _gone_ in a flash, reduced to dust, lifted and disbursed by arcane means. Then more explosions. Crying - screaming. While Huldar dons his shield and charges into the street, Mayvra and Karna survey what’s left of nearby buildings. Huddled in the rubble, arms up on either side of her head, is a small human girl with dirty blond hair, dressed in ragged clothes. Her face is strangely blank of expression. Karna advances, hand out, attempting to keep the girl at ease. Just as Karna sees the facade of the girl’s face give way for the briefest moment, he sees also an older brown skinned man hopping nimbly through the debris at remarkable speed. The man takes the girls hand, and she follows him willingly - toward the Cinder Spire. And it was then, for the first time, that you saw packs of snarling, kobolds dressed in uncommonly fine linens. The pursuit was on.
		- A blast of a strange, radiant flame from Huldar just barely missed one kobold. As you chased, you saw ahead the man reach the Cinder Spire and reveal a door hidden for years. As you followed, Mayvra saw that another gang of kobolds chasing from behind stopped, as if their steadfast pursuit was no longer needed. Inside the tower, all three of you unloaded on two of the kobolds - Karna wielded his glaive with brutal speed and precision, a second blast of radiant flame from Huldar - this time - struck true, and a lash of lightning from Mayvra let her pull the remaining kobold from the stairs. With the sound of a scuffle echoing down from the next level, you paused to observe a room with a sourceless diffuse light. On high 30 foot walls, obscured by massive silver link curtains, was an indecipherable writing. Enough, you think, to fill a weighty tome.
		- But there were more kobolds on the floor above. Rushing up the stairs, you found the old man surrounded, and the kobolds attacked with brutality. Tragically, the man fell - and as he did, the spell obscuring the small girl’s true form gave way. You saw now a fey creature with unnaturally large, white, iris-free, and glassy eyes. Introductions would have to wait, as you moved with resolve. Mayvra revealed a capacity for flight, soaring directly into the fray. But the kobolds showed their own ferocious resolve, and in close combat daggers flashing, Mayvra fell to the ground, unconscious. Huldar reached out with a healing hand, and her wounds mended, eyes flashing open. Eventually, all of the kobolds lay dead - and the young fey creature wordlessly connected with you all. She stooped over the man - evidently a caretaker - and kissed his forehead. It felt reverent. But now you saw there was something here for her to do. She reached her hand out for Karna, and he took it.
		- As Mayvra stayed below and took stock of the scene, Huldar and Karna followed this fey being into one of the three narrow spires. There, they found a tall marble statue of a woman - advanced in years and quite beautiful. Held in and outstretched hand: an orb, glowing faintly. The fey creature reached up for the opaque stone, hoping Karna would retrieve for her. With Huldar looking on and marveling at the arcane energy that surrounded it - Karna plucked the orb from the statue’s hand. He looked to Huldar for confirmation - and both seemed to hesitate. But finally, Karna handed it to the girl. It glowed with greater strength, lifting from her hands as she, in turn, lifted with it. As the fey took in a deep breath, a bright, blue-white light overpowered the chamber. Through his splayed fingers, Karna saw the orb push into her chest, fusing with her form.
		- It was over. The creature’s feet clicked as she landed on the floor. She released a long exhalation, turned to Karna, and motioned for him to stoop down. She patted her chest. “Zaida,” she said. Then Zaida patted Karna. “Hope,” she said, as her fey smile broadened.

		- Huldar
		- Karna
		- Mayvra
		- Sameera
	- Session Start
		- We begin in the Cinder Spire - a strange shrine to a forgotten time. For years, everything within has remained motionless, untouched. The air is dry, but oddly fresh smelling - save for the scene of kobold blood.
		- Above, in one of the spires, Karna stoops in front of Zaida as she touches his cheek, Huldar watching from a cautious distance.
		- But on the floor below, Mayvra - our cardigan sporting, reluctant sorcerer - you stand over the body of the linen-clad kobold that only moments before struck you down.
		- Despite what just happened in the spire above you, it’s quiet.
		- What is Mayvra doing at this moment?
		- There’s a sound of something on the kobold shifting _ever_ so slightly. Its arm slides lifeless to the floor, and a thin jacket that it wears flops open.
		- Clang. Clang clang clang.
		- A small bronze colored orb, about the size of a small grapefruit rolls out of the jacket and onto the floor.
		- Its surface is covered in intricate mechanics. You see there is one spot on this orb that has been slid open, revealing an open hole.
		- What do you do?
	- Scenes
		- The group explores the remaining two chambers of the Cinder Spire and deals with arcane signatures emitting from one of the Scions.
		- Sameera appears on the scene as the group prepares to exit the Cinder Spire - and is recognized by Zaida.
		- Returning to Wyrfall proper, the group settles business with allies - Miali, Fynn, and Irrun.
		- Agent Gallen approaches the group, telling them of the Gray Guard’s movements and intel that places the Scions of Lo’Thos at Farhaven Ruin.
		- Eventually, the group decides to either track the Scions to Farhaven Ruin or head to Il Ausper.
		- If the group heads to Il Ausper, they commandeer a boat at the Cleftstone Docks and are attacked by three Chokers in the Southern Breakwater.
		- If the group heads to the Farhaven Ruin, they are stalked - and then attacked - by a Quaggoth Thonot and two Scions of Lo’Thos.
	- Secrets & Clues
		- The Gray Guard were drawn to Il Ausper by a distress call, received by Full Marshal Rone Brightgrave, that followed the assassination of four members of the Circle of Six.
		- The Cinder Spire serves as vault for the Graft of Briccriu - an object lying in wait, ready to fuse with the next incarnation of the Hope Cipher.
		- Akio Kiran, The Devoted has been living quietly in Wyrfall for months, keeping Zaida close to the Graft of Briccriu and waiting for the day she would be prepared to receive it.
		- The White Ravens, a small crew of treasure seekers based out of Il Ausper, encountered what a lone survivor described as a “massive demon” two days southwest of the city.
		- The Scions of Lo’Thos carry six clockwork spheres, each the size of a grapefruit, that can be tuned to disrupt and scatter any material that falls within the tuning’s resonant frequency.
		- The Scions’ clockwork spheres are tuned to the frequency of materials used in most of Wyrfall’s buildings; other buildings across the town sustain surface damage.
		- Evidence suggests the Scions of Lo’Thos coordinated their attack on Wyrfall from the Farhaven Ruin, northeast and across the river from Il Ausper.
		- Miali Glim’s ancestors served as sentries for the Hope of Ioun and vowed to protect the Cinder Spire at all costs.
		- Kord - the Storm Lord - is the lone god to have already begun their return; he will speak to Mayvra throughout his journey.
		- Thenolin - Huldar's dwarven master - has been working on the restoration of a [sentient] warhammer brought to them by treasure hunters that allegedly found the weapon at the edge of the Night’s Quarter.

With the terrifying electric avatar of a long-absent god hovering before her, Mayvra’s mind was filled with splinters of memory that clicked against each other and calcified into something visible and visual, a brief chain of moments hanging in time. A druid grandmother, a community of renewal druids, all wielding fire. The grandmother’s death. The Circle’s loss of control. And that moment: dawn, and Mayvra’s house on fire. Something is in her house. She *needs* it. But she cannot move. Behind her, a storm builds, rain beginning to wet her fur. As the memory took hold and her attention returned to the present day, a detail hung in her mind. That fire had started in darkness, the sun well below the horizon. And that brilliant dawn. Tears streamed down her cheeks.

Here, in this time, the words of the Storm Lord rumbled for all to hear: “Good. Prove yourselves.” And they did. Mayvra lightning lured the avatar, pulling it towards her, making an opening for Sameera to send an arrow moving at incredible speed into the heart of the apparition. As Huldar’s ethereal mace swung through it, the avatar recoiled - and then exploded, sending a giant beam of lightning directly into Karna’s chest, knocking him from his feet. As Zaida charged to his side, Huldar tossed her a potion of healing. “What … *is* this?” she squeaked, before taking Huldar’s direction and slamming it forcibly down Karna’s gullet. Mayvra threw her hands behind her and a wave of thunderous force pummeled the apparition - and again, it retaliated, this time dropping Zaida. As it rose above their heads, Huldar shouted after it. “Prove YOUR self!” Karna, bleary eyed, propped himself up, took aim, and loosed an axe into its center. Finally, it gave up its form, its energy rippling outwards.

This energy changed and calmed. “I am close,” this avatar said. “Closer than they realize. A god, but you need not bow. A god, but you need not believe. You are my fist. You are the harbinger. To you, I grant this gift.” Lightning encircled Mayvra, consuming her, branching out from her and lifting her off the ground. The gift was granted - and Kord departed. As Huldar tended to an unconscious Zaida, Mayvra scoped out a rise in the distance. Upon arrival, you found what turned out to be a massive arcane orrery. But at the moment, it was rest that was needed. As folks bedded down, Huldar intoned to Mayvra, “Is your name really Destiny?” Then, he stammered, “Are you okay? You maybe were … crying? I just wanted to … you know, check.” Mayvra was resolute. “I wasn’t crying. The lightning was in my eyes.” And the night passed quietly. In the light of pre-dawn, Sameera could make out a pencil-thin line of smoke on the horizon - a small camp perhaps. But it seemed to pose no danger.

After sunrise, Huldar found himself at the control panel of a functional but ancient and badly neglected Orrery. Through the use of an Identify spell and a series of deft moves, he, Zaida, and Sameera managed to navigate ethereal images of galaxies and planets that were, presumably, an incalculable distance away. Huldar locked on one planet not so different from Nerah - but when he released the controls, the arcane machine powered down, perhaps full of secrets still untapped. Before making off for the Penumbra Range, Sameera called Yuska, asking her her exact location - and confirming the group was close. “Delightful,” she responded. “You’re within a day’s travel. Follow the eastern side of the range. Trust me - you’ll see it.”

They were off. The five passed by the massive, explosive wound - the genesis of the Penumbra Range, a chill air surrounding them. Maybe it was Mayvra’s memory of her grandmother that triggered it - maybe not - but a gut sense caused her to look twice at an odd turn of stone. Lo and behold, rough hewn stairs tucked back at the edge of the rubble lead to a ridgeline trail, cutting precious hours of tough climb from their journey. They climbed and climbed, a breathtaking vista sprawling beneath them.

And then: temptation. A shattered ridge of crystalline ice revealed a dark cavern below. The group wanted a peak, but without Mia to send down, Huldar would need to meditate a bit to summon her back to this plane. As he did so, Sameera trekked ahead - and saw it for the first time - three ornate towers, floating above a great ledge branching from the Penumbra’s tallest peak. Golden rings of light hovered around the largest tower. Tiny platforms whisked along and between the towers. Sameera excitedly reported back, but Mia was ready. And this group … this group chose danger.

Mia fluttered down into the abyss to find a circuitous drop of about 200 feet - and at the bottom was gold. *Lots* of gold. As she circled, a chunk of ice crumbled from the wall and revealed the shape of a small, puckish ice sprite. It flew wide circles as it yipped and clicked. There was some debate, but the decision also seemed like it was already made. As Zaida and Mayvra watched from the top, Zaida’s feet dangling into the crevasse, the other three tied off their ropes and spelunked down. Mayvra for her part tossed their rope down when Huldar, Sameera, and Karna realized they needed more rope.

At the bottom, Huldar and Karna - finding the rope still short - dropped the last fifteen feet, and Sameera deftly swung wide and tied the rope off against a craggy, crystalline wall. The gold. So much gold. But also: Mephits. Five more of them, peeling free. Then a massive crunching sound as a much larger form, 25 feet in height, pushing itself forward out of the wall. Sameera clocks a ring on its finger as it raises its hand to its face and balls its crystalline fingers into a massive, boulder size fist. The cavern is quiet, filled only with yipping and clicks, as the golem dropped its shoulder, ready to charge.

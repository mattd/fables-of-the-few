	- Recap
		- High atop the Penumbra Mountain Range, Mayvra and Zaida sat at the edge of a jagged crevasse of crystalline ice. As Zaida swung her legs in large arcs, back and forth in turn, the two could hear the sound of ice and stone walls collapsing below. “Will we help?” Zaida chirped. Mayvra let out a long, labored sigh - and the two scaled quickly into the void. As Ice Mephits gathered and dove, Huldar blinked out of sight and invisibly charged this golem of elemental cold. Karna’s glaive - and stone-cold game face - stopped a Mephit right where they hovered, giving Sameera the perfect opening to unload a charge with brutal gut-shot accuracy. And then another. And then another. When Huldar struck at the golem, causing Huldar to flicker into view, the creature’s head swiveled, and an ear shattering laser canon of ice struck our Firbolg directly in the chest. Zaida’s voice echoed off the walls as she and Mayvra arrived: “What did we miss?”
		- The battle was _vicious_. As Mayvra wind-kicked through the crowd, her staff alit with radiant energy, Huldar was struck down, chilled by a second blast of elemental energy. But Karna was able to knock the creatures legs out, and it was Mayvra who got the final blow - an explosion of thunder that shattered its body, the linked Mephits exploding in quick succession soon after.
		- Zaida sat by Huldar, waiting patiently for him to awaken. And almost immediately after, it was looting time. Huldar maybe literally drooled as he magi-crafted a massive backpack for an even more massive haul of coin. The group also clocked a tourmaline ring or resistance the monster had worn. And glimmering faintly the corner, Mayvra found an uncut diamond, a gem encased within what looked like rough, volcanic stone. It was solid in the hand, and she smiled briefly as she tested its weight.
		- The five made their way back - Huldar much more slowly - up the crevasse to the Penumbra ridgeline where they all watched Evangelion from a distance as it seemed to slowly morph or transform before them - towers reforming, structures changing. But there was ground left to cover, and they wisely divvied up the heavy spoils to better navigate a long cable bridge, Zaida looking wide eyed as always - “We’re so high!” Then, finally, you were there. On a wide, level ledge most of the way up a tall peak, Evangelion - semi-terrestrial home of the Hope of Ioun - seemed to test out and search for its final form. One part of a tower fanned open, taking the form of a spiral stair that clicked into place. Doors swung open, revealing a sanctuary - and there stood Yuska Rei - the last of the Circle of Six.
		- Yuska’s reunion with Sameera and Zaida was warm, but Karna sensed a strange vibe - ecstatic, almost unhinged. With their conversation having been limited for some time by the Sending Stone, Sameera took the opportunity to fill in gaps for Yuska. One of those gaps was the deal the five had made with Oglazath to procure the seventh of the Blades of the Silver Sun - and at this Yuska panicked. They really shouldn’t have dealt with Saiviel’s lackeys. But Huldar’s humor calmed her, and soon Yuska lead the group - reverently - inside. It was time to meet the Hope of Ioun.
		- In a kaleidoscopic sanctuary, slowly but constantly reforming, the Hope was there - High Curator Kwelan Amikye and Curator Veo Doorna. At once, Sameera notices Zaida’s expression freeze, and Mayvra sees an immovable stiffness to the small fey’s stance. The High Curator, at long last and Yuska’s prompting, finally offered a history. Many thousands of years in the past, Nerah found itself caught in a constant cycle of sunrise and sunset. Darkness gripped the world, and the days gave little respite from the relentless terrors of the night. Some in the Age of Many learned to harness the powers of the dark - and they abused these powers mightily. The world seemed beyond saving. The gods turned away, fixing their focus on other, more promising worlds.
		- Eventually, two archfey rose - a pair bound in a continual chain of death and rebirth. Saiviel Worldkeeper convinced one of the few gods that remained - Avandra, a god of chaos - that Nerah required drastic measures. The archfey asked Avandra to leave this task of building a better Nerah to them, and a deal was struck. The god would sunder nearly everything, and stop the world’s rotation. Saiviel, for their part, would watch over a chosen Few as they slept - and usher those that remained into a new world on waking. But something went wrong. The darkness somehow held fast - and holds fast today. This darkness is, in fact, a danger to _everything_. The attention of the gods begins to turn back to Nerah. Ioun, The Knowing Mother, will return and learn the history of the few. The darkness shall not spread. All worlds will be saved.
		- Curator Doorna turned to Zaida, knowingly touching her face. Huldar sidled forward - promising drastic action of his own if the Curators made any kind of move on Zaida - and suddenly the room was all tension. But as Doorna explained, Zaida, as the bearer of the Graft of Briccriu is now inseparable from Nerah’s historical record. And now Yuska - near panic after watching this meeting drift sideways - tried to explain. There was no stopping it, no choice in the matter, no rescue. Karna, for his part, offered the seventh Blade - an errand, an exchange. And Yuska searched for a way to reconcile. Evangelion was not ready, she said. More time was needed - and the hour was late. Let them stay, Yuska asked the Curator. We’ll find a way through in the morning.
		- The Curators agreed and ascended, floating off to some unseen chamber. The five troubled heroes were lead below, down stairs that formed like minute clockwork right before them. Beds circled a smooth dome, which Zaida touched - revealing a twisting cosmos. Starlight lit her face as the others looked on. Finally, quietly, Zaida whispered: “I’m in trouble.”

	- Session Start
		- [Scene Setting]
			- We pick up at that exact moment where we left off.
			- Huldar, Mayvra, Karna, and Sameera stand in a round windowless room directly beneath the sanctuary of Evangelion. Or at least you _assume_ you’re still directly beneath the sanctuary. Though the walls here in the Moonkeeper’s Ward aren’t as prismatic and kaleidoscopic as the room above, you can hear the faint hum and click beneath every surface. It’s a skitter of movement as this vessel continues to reshape and change, searching for its true form.
			- Zaida’s small hand still rests on a large dome upon which slowly swirls the breathtakingly realistic image of a vast cosmos. Around this dome are curved beds, linens carefully tucked, all forming a large ring, head to toe, around the dome.
			- Suddenly, there’s a discordant clacking and a higher pitched whir. Karna, you’re closest to one of the two stairwells that opened to permit you entry into this chamber. The stairs are pulling back into the wall. And the hole in the ceiling from which the stairs descend is closing like an aperture.
			- What do you do?
		- [Karna and the Curse]
			- Karna, you fade into … something. This happens suddenly, but it takes a moment to come to focus. You see only a low-lit haze at first. And you blink your eyes - your real physical eyes. This is not a vision. It can’t be that. You _feel_ where you are.
			- But you’re not in Evangelion. You’re in the Farhaven Ruins. You’re in that cavernous room, black walls that glint in the low light. And standing before you is Oglazath. You are at that _exact_ moment after he cast the curse on you and the others.
			- But they’re not here. You’re alone with him. He flaps his wings twice, coming to eye level and swooping close to you. So close that you can smell his breath. Like bitter spices.
			- “It seems like you thought … I wasn’t serious.”
			- His expression darkens further. “You offered … what you swore would be theirs.”
			- Then suddenly you are wracked by unbelievable pain. Your face and the left side of your head. Your eye, running back to your ear and to the bace of your neck.
			- “You offered what you _owe_.”
			- It’s blinding, unbearable. You fall to your knees. You can’t see - only a brilliant white, searing pain.
			- And now all you hear is a voice: “Do not. Test. Us.”
			- And then [snaps]. Just like that - you’re back.
		- [Evangelion and Yuska]
			- You feel a tremor. Under foot. Brief. Barely noticeable.
			- Then another. But this one takes hold. It’s sustained - low and long. Then for a second, it’s bone rattling.
			- And then, suddenly, there’s a lurch, brief, and straight upward. And the tremor is gone.
			- [Then a new sound - a fast series of clacks and clicks, and an eerie, almost organic whine.]
			- You see Yuska dart into view. She’s frantic.
			- “They’re leaving with you. They’re leaving with _all_ of you.”
			- She pauses, like she’s considering something.
			- “They’re not gonna hurt you.”
			- Then she pauses again. She’s considering something else.
			- “Please - don’t hurt them. For the sake of Nerah - don’t hurt them.”
	- Scenes
		- Stairs and entrances to the Moonkeeper’s Ward close, leaving the group trapped within.

	- Locations
		- Evangelion
			- Moonkeeper’s Ward
				- A round room with curving beds arranged closely together, head to foot, in a ring.
				- A large semi-spherical dome sits in the middle of the ring and on its surface drifts images of an infinite, galaxy-filled space.
				- Two semi-mechanized, curving stairs lead to the floor above.
			- Kaleidoscope Sanctuary Transformed
				- A sanctuary reformed, with a flat floor but oddly asymmetrical and curving walls like the inside of a malformed egg.
				- Walls still glimmering like some strange, colorless kaleidoscope of crystal and white stone.
				- On the wider end, the chamber is open to the world, a ten foot wide round entrance that appears to blossom outwards.
				- Even now, the room is changing - transforming.
		- Motley Wilds
			- A verdant, crowded, and sprawling hollow tucked along the western foot of the Penumbra.
			- Brilliant colors and the heady, musky smells of full blooms and ripe fruits.
			- Where the wilds abut the Penumbra, stoney caves and fissures interrupt thick growth in a random but frequent rhythm.
		- Pref’s Covert
			- Exterior
				- A slanted and jagged fissure, wider at the bottom and extending up and to the right like a large gash, 20 feet in length.
				- Tucked off to the side are two pliant and well-worn leather boots with an abnormal long toe box.
				- Ten feet in, an imprecise but entirely unnatural burrow arcs steeply down and out of view.
			- Burrow
				- The tunnel ends in an unbelievably narrow and steep stair - almost like a ladder carved into the stone.
				- A single room, with roughly carved walls, a ceiling that slants up at a shallow angle to the left, and a smooth and level stone floor.
				- Where the far wall should be, there’s not a wall, exactly - but rather a natural, imperfect curvature with a rough surface.
				- A massive crystal with a course surface - maybe a diamond, even - mostly translucent and below it or within it a blue glow blow.
				- A small bed - two thin mattresses and a pillow stacked atop each other - a low table, and a round, colorful woven rug - too clean for such a strange, remote room.
				- Arcane baubles - probably part of some light spell - hang close to the ceiling, filling the room with a warm glow.

By the light of the blue glow from an opaque wall in Dawn Walker Pref Patar’s burrow, Huldar traced the glyph of a Detect Magic spell in the air. Pref had just healed Karna from the group’s devastating skirmish with Curator Doorna, and now he sidled silently up to Huldar. As Pref explained, many believe the frost worm colossus Taenoth the Uncorrupted formed the Penumbra Range when they violently burrowed beneath Nerah’s surface. Pref was honestly pretty understated about this history, though - there’s a lot of strange stuff that happens in this world. Soon, Mayvra, Sameera, Huldar, Karna, and Zaida were all following Pref through fields of tall, blue-green grass west of the Northern Amble. This is when Sameera’s head began to throb, slow and rhythmic - and it seemed to originate from the north. Immediately, Pref was troubled. “Who are you? Where have you been?” he asked - and then explained that though he’d never cared to risk finding out why, those that have known other planes of existence seem to have a connection to the source of Sameera’s pain.

Choosing to investigate, the six found a Nightstone Monolith, which Sameera recognized was  made of the same material mined from Farhaven. As Sameera carefully circled the bent and jagged monolith, her friends passed out of view, and for the briefest of moments, she could make out a figure within - tall, pale, and wearing robes that gathered into strange shifting spikes. Mayvra, wired as she is to fidget and touch and feel, steps forward and lays her hand on its surface. To the others, this is a momentary thing, but to Mayvra time stops - and her arm sinks in to the elbow, as if submerged in a cool liquid. Maybe don’t touch it, she cautions the others. It wants to pull us in. They may have been about to leave, but Karna stepped forward, and - perhaps out of frustration - swung his glaive at the structure … and it sank through. As time stands still, a hand grabs the glaive and *pulls* Karna inside. Karna stands face to face with an eight foot tall creature. They have a featureless, roiling face like constantly moving clay. This, Karna correctly guessed, was Saiviel Second-Of-The-Name. Their face calmed, and took on slight, delicate features. “I know you, Karna. You have caused many troubles already. Thank you … for letting me know where you are.” Karna is pushed out, and quickly counsels the group to move. Fast.

At camp that evening, Pref explained his anxiety and troubled mood. The story will be hard to tell, as an enchantment keeps him from divulging certain details, his voice occasionally lost in a static-y hiss. What the group *does* come to learn is that Pref Patar took oaths long ago as a Dawn Walker - the descendant of a people that remained awake during the Silent Slumber, a period of 60,000 years between the Age of the Many and the Age of the Few - awake when everyone else slept. The Dawn Walkers' oath is to Saiviel, but Pref either knows precious little of this entity - or he’s unable to say. His family - his mother, his great-great grandparents, generation after generation - they all took the oath. They rarely gather now, but they all believe they work for the good of a world worth saving. Exhausted from the emotions this surfaces, Pref sleeps soundly, and the group whispers quietly, Karna questioning whether they can trust someone aligned with Saiviel. “It’s a crappy world when you start to distrust everyone,” Huldar quips. And before everyone beds down, Sameera’s thoughts turn to Yuska. She pulls out the Circle’s Sending Stone, now recharged, and attempts to deceive Yuska about the group’s bearing. “You must feel great hurt, but don’t lie to me, Sameera. Amikye heads for the Nameless City - just south of the northern edge of Midsommar.”  Huldar conjures Mia, and during his watch, approaches - but avoids - a pack of roaming Owlbear in close range of the camp.

The next day, the group passed some distance south of the Sombrewood, a strange and spacious forest crowded with deep shadows. The veil between worlds is thin here, and Pref believes the one you seek - Archdruid Oristivius Quan - may have emerged from a gate hidden within. But it’s later that day that things suddenly go sideways. Pref sniffs the air. “Well, I’ll be.” And then vanishes. Moments later, it becomes clear they’ve been stalked, as three cursed owlbears pad quietly towards the group. The group narrowly avoids a vicious ambush, giving themselves precious seconds to brace for impact. Karna’s whirling dance of violence drops one quickly - and further maneuvers pull the remaining two from their feet. Sameera’s arrows, surgically precise, find purchase - but in between attacks, she is knocked unconscious, her blood covering the ground. Huldar mutters a word of healing - and Sameera is pulled from the brink of death. Zaida is flanked and in real danger - but an unexpected fury fills her eyes. The whole squad comes to her aid in their own way, Mia zipping around one owlbear’s head as distraction. Mayvra pulls a massive, stony diamond from her pocket - holding it aloft, unable to contain the surge of energy now accessible to her. And as a massive thrum of arcane energy echoes across the plane, Huldar runs at the last living owlbear prone on the ground.

With his mace lit by the flame of Moradin, Huldar swung away, finishing this cursed beast, its feathers catching fire. And there was overkill. Terrible overkill, Huldar hunched over the beast, looking unhinged. Right then, Pref crested the top of the embankment. “Huh. You … uh. You look like you all can take care of yourselves,” he said - with the great owlbear corpse quite obviously ablaze. And loping forward from behind him, two massive and brilliantly colored Myceloids - fungal humanoids, dazed and glamored by the ranger’s arcane talents. Pref smiled wanly. “I found us some friends.”

- In Session
	- Started in Pref’s burrow, Pref healed Karna, Huldar cast detect magic - “Whatcha doin?”
	- Tells them of the forming of the Penumbra Range - Frost Worm Colossus named Taenoth the Uncorrupted.
	- Heads out, crosses the Northern Amble.
	- Sameera feels a headache that throbs with a slow rythm. Pref: “Who *are* you?” Circle of Six, he doesn't know. Or, more specifically, “where have you been?”
	- They go, play with it, she walks around, sees a figure. Mayvra ambles forward and touches, it hand sinks in, nobody else sees this. “Yo, we should leave this alone - it … wants to pull us in.”
	- Karna swings his glaive against the Monolith, something pulls him in. “I know *you,* Karna. You have caused much trouble for us already.” “Who are you?” “Guess.” “Saiviel” - “Yes, Saiviel, Second-Of-The-Name”.
	- “Thank you. Thank you for showing me … where you are.” Pushes him out.
	- They mention Saiviel, and Pref looks entirely spooked. “Again,” Pref says. “Who *are* you? You are in deeper than you know.”
	- Talk about the Dawn Walkers, can’t tell them everything.
	- Exhausted afterwards.
	- Pref is asleep, and Huldar says:
		- Crappy world when you start to distrust everyone.
	- Huldar brought back Mia before sleep.

	- Recap
		- Righteously pissed from a brutal series of stabs to the gut, Mayvra kicked her now-dead attacker, a linen-clad kobold, heavily in the side. The Cinder Spire was quiet and calm, and from one of the three towers, still marveling over Zaida’s absorption of a mysterious orb, Huldar and Karna could hear the “clang … clang clang” of an empty metal orb falling from the kobold’s clothes and rolling across the floor. Mayvra saw the orb had a highly mechanized exterior, and on inspection, Huldar knew - vaguely - that its origin was tied to an order of arcane practitioners in the north. This one was hollow and sported a hole, but a second orb on another kobold was heavier and entirely closed. The group pocketed both. But there was more looting to be done. Up a stair next to a painting of three moons - including a bright blue moon no one’s ever seen - Huldar found and pocketed a carefully hung gold necklace set with a large ruby. In the other tower - above a painting of three stylized eyes set in a triangle - they found some errant coin and a letter in an unfamiliar script, the only trace of common being a salutation that read “Mir Glim”.
		- On their way out, Huldar looted the kobolds and then weighed the cost-benefit of stealing thousands of pounds of silver curtains, even briefly considering climbing on Mayvra’s ample shoulders to get more height. Instead, he settled on cutting off a small swath. As he was hacking at it, a nimble and frantic looking elf ran breathless into the Spire’s main hall. This, it turned out, was Sameera. While the group tried to contextualize their connections with each other and their locations during the destruction of Wyrfall, Zaida ran up to Sameera and leaped into her arms. Up until now, Sameera knew only of Zaida’s human guise, but she’s glad to see her - and the revelation that these three were now looking after Zaida seemed to encourage some level of trust between Sameera and the rest of you.
		- The group, sadly, had to inform Sameera that the man she came to find, Akio Kiran, was dead. Sameera explained that Akio was one of the Circle of Six, a group of mystics that work on behalf of a much larger group that Sameera refers to as the Hope of Ioun. Sameera has for a short time worked for the Circle as spy and messenger, and this morning, another of the six - Yuska Rei - came to Sameera in a panic. “Things are moving faster than the Circle ever dreamed,” Yuska said. “Go to Wyrfall and tell Akio the Hope of Ioun has returned. If Akio has read the signs, he will have already gone to the Cinder Spire. Find him there.” Yuska gave Sameera a small stone with a circle of swirling branches on it, telling her Akio would know how to use it.
		- The five began heading back to town, and Zaida - surprisingly - re-sealed the Cinder Spire with but a glance. The town was in shambles, coated in a thick grey dust. While some parts of Wyrfall’s buildings were vaporized, others still stood, and nearly all personal effects were strangely in tact. Gathering his shop’s weapons stock was Irrun - a capri-sporting bugbear and business associate of Huldar. Irrun was trying to make sense of what happened, and told the four of a group of treasure hunters called the White Ravens. They claimed to have seen a massive demon two days south of Wyrfall. Only one survived, and they’re now home in Il Ausper. Irrun sent his regards to Huldar’s mentor, Thenolin, and the group went in search of - and found - Miali Glim. Karna soon showed her the letter from the Spire - and Miali was _shook_ by what she saw. It turns out “Mir” is an antiquated honorific, and Mir Glim refers to her father, Ottavio Glim. This, in fact, is the reason Miali lives in Wyrfall. Years ago, her father worked as a sentry protecting the Cinder Spire, helping the Circle to help protect an “object of great influence” as Ottavio would often refer to it. Miali desperately wanted to know what was actually _in_ the Spire, but Karna stopped short of describing the orb. Karna _did_ introduce her to Zaida, though, and Miali noted that since Akio moved to Wyrfall quietly several months ago, the human girl she now knows to be Zaida has rarely left his side.
		- Bidding Miali farewell for now, the group decided to head for Il Ausper. On your way to the docks and the boat Sameera borrowed from Yuska, you ran into a Gray Guardsman. Karna was a bit brusk with the guy, but he had seen your heroic actions, and shared some intel despite the reception. The Guard has a tight relationship with the Circle of Six, and Full Marshall Rone Brightgrave received an urgent summons the night before. _Something_ has happened to the Circle. The situation was serious enough to cause the Full Marshall to bring the entire Guard with him, leaving only Agent Gallen in Wyfall. “We were so blind,” he lamented.
		- This only hardened the group’s resolve. From the Cleftstone Docks, the group piloted the Circle’s fishing boat across the Southern Breakwater. Then Huldar saw it - a dark form on the water. You had only a brief moment to prepare as three boneless, tooth-handed chokers threw themselves onto the deck, attacking with ferocious speed and extraordinary reach. One of the chokers lunged with both arms at Huldar, and he was brought down, bleeding profusely, clinging to life. His friends fought valiantly to protect him. Mayvra, under pressure, reached for the magic she doesn’t fully understand. Karna, a spinning master of the glaive. Mia flitting to the aid of her new companions. Zaida, brandishing a sleek shortsword hidden and strapped to her back, carving expertly at each tentacle in her reach. And Sameera, ducking in the hold, missing her first two longbow shots, and then landing the third with devastating accuracy, ending the battle.
		- At the end, it was Mayvra that kneeled next to Huldar. In the Breakwater’s stiff wind, her eyes leaked a misty light. This same light issued from her hand as she reached out to touch the worst of Huldar’s wounds. Though not healed, the bleeding ceased, and the Firbolg woke. Mayvra nodded. “I’m as confused as you are.”

	- Session Start
		- We begin on a fishing boat in the Southern Breakwater just south of Il Ausper. This day has a Southern Origin, and as mid-day has given way to evening, the sun has lowered, and taken on a golden cast. The small, gently lapping waves of the Breakwater glint with its light. The air is warm, wet, and smells distinctly of brine.
		- The four of you have had a few minutes to collect yourself after your fight with the Chokers. Their thick, green-black blood stains the deck.
		- Huldar: Zaida kneels next to you where you recuperate, with a look like a mix of empathy and curiosity. She reaches up with the sleeve of her tight black tunic and rubs a smear of blood from your temple.
		- What are the four of you doing as the boat cuts through the Breakwater?
		- Suddenly, the boat feels like it shifts _ever_ so slightly beneath you. Zaida raises her face into the air and then dashes with near-silent steps to the prow of the boat.
		- What do you do?
		- Huldar and Sameera - you know almost immediately what this is. Your boat is now being pulled - slowly at first, but with a _very_ gradually increasing speed - towards a city that is now fully visible to the north.
		- Zaida hops down from a platform at the prow and quickly darts up the boats mast, wrapping up the sail with a relaxed and practiced grace. She then swings down into the hold where Sameera hid during your fight with the chokers, and using all her strength to begin hoisting up one of a set of large oars.
		- You see her very consciously try to conjure words.
		- “Slow!” she urges, trying to hand you the oar.
		- What do you do?
	- Scenes
		- Huldar experiences a portentous vision of Moradin.
		- The group attempts to glide gracefully into Il Ausper’s southern port and are met by a noticeably anxious Breakwater Guard.
		- If turned away by the Guard, the group must find an alternate method of entrance to the city.
		- Once inside, the group discovers a populous largely going about their business - but strange signs of stress and suppressed panic begin to crop up.
		- A strange flock of owls circle over Il Ausper, and the group investigates.
		- As the sun falls in the northern sky, the group finds rest - either at an Inn or at the home of a trusted ally.
		- The group attempts to identify the Periapt of Wound Closure and Sending Stone (linked to Yuska).
		- Lead by Huldar - and possibly looking for answers - the group heads to Thenolin’s workshop.
		- Sameera leads her new friends to the Temple of the Six - and discovers only she and Zaida are able to see it.
		- Once inside the Temple of the Six, the group finds the entire Gray Guard and three of the Circle dead; one of the Circle - Maruna Keen, the Patient - is near death, overcome by some strange, necrotic curse.
		- Before she dies, Maruna tells the group of two things: the staging ground for the attack on Wyrfall and Yuska’s escape.
		- The group departs the city for their mission of choice - and soon find themselves confronted by unfriendlies.
	- Secrets & Clues
		- The Void Whorl beneath Il Ausper is the result of work done by Andel Glass and the Glass Academy to harness the untapped power of adjacent planes.
		- The basin that holds Il Ausper aloft is equipped with six gate stones that push against the planar magic that lies at the bottom of the Void Whorl.
		- Glass has discovered a method of using planar energy to massively expand the effective area of certain spells - including the Calm Emotions spell currently cast on Il Ausper’s populace.
		- The Temple of the Six is hidden by illusion magic that can only be seen past through the use of Truesight granted by one aligned with the Hope of Ioun.
		- The Temple of the Six was raided by Lo’Thos and a band of Troglodyte Scions.
		- Yuska escaped the Scions through the use of a Cape of the Mountebank; Lo’Thos lost her trail just east of the Glass Academy.
		- Yuska is headed for the Evangelion - the Hope of Ioun’s long-abandoned mountain fortress at the far end of the Penumbra Spine mountain range, three days north of Il Ausper.
		- Evidence suggests the Scions of Lo’Thos coordinated their attack on Wyrfall from the Farhaven Ruin, northwest and across the river from Il Ausper.
		- Lo’Thos is monitoring Il Ausper via a triad of spectral night owls, capable of cloaking any near them in the dark of night; they search for any sign of the Graft of Briccriu or the Hope Cipher.
		- Fynn is dead, having just been killed by recently awoken Berbalang acolytes of Saiviel First-of-the-Name; they were searching for the relic Fynn and Karna stole.
		- Kord - the Storm Lord - is the lone god to have already begun their return; he will speak to Mayvra throughout his journey.
		- Thenolin - Huldar's dwarven master - has been working on the restoration of Oblivion, a [sentient] warhammer brought to them by treasure hunters that allegedly found the weapon at the edge of the Night’s Quarter.

	- Huldar’s Vision
		- Everything is haze - not black, not white, not gray. All colors and no colors. It’s shifting, and also perfectly still.
		- In the midst of this no-place, there’s a glow in the distance. Or there’s a glow right next to you. You can’t tell which.
		- What do you do?
		- Two heartbeats pass, and in that short span of time, the glow solidifies and becomes clear. You see that this is a forge - but it is unlike any forge you have ever seen. This forge is like a great cylinder, 20 feet from side to side, its bottom quarter separated from the top, which hangs above it, attached to some ceiling far above you that you cannot see.
		- A short stair leads up into the midst of the forge. Many jets of bright blue and white flame, unimaginably hot, are built around the perimeter of both the top and bottom of this cylinder. In this world, we might say this looked like a complex rocket engine. But surely no such thing exists in this universe.
		- In the center of the forge stands a short, stout figure with wiry jet black hair tied into many braids that flows out in from a full helmet. They’re dressed in unimaginably ornate armor. They support lean forward against a large stone bowl, 6 feet in diameter. This bowl floats at the center of the forge. This figure’s back is turned to you.

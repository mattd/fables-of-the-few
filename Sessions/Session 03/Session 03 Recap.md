Huldar, firbolg cleric of Moradin the All Hammer, found himself in a place outside space and time. Before him was a forge unlike any he had seen, and leaning against it, an avatar of Moradin himself. Moradin granted Huldar a gift of pure creation, allowing him to forge objects from some eternal source of light and heat. “I am far from you,” Moradin said. “But there is one among us who rushes to return.” Moradin promised that Nerah’s salvation may not be a given, but there is Hope. Maybe Huldar and his companions will do better than the gods have done. And then, just like that, Huldar awoke.

The city of Il Ausper was *not* what Karna and Mayvra expected. Your boat lurched slightly as a current pulled you in - and as you drifted closer, the city’s strangest open secret became apparent. Il Ausper is built *above* what many call the Void Whorl - a weakness between the planes of existence, currently exploited by a mage named Andel Glass. As the five of you expertly guided your vessel into dock, a crew of Breakwater guards questioned your passage. Two looked oddly agitated, but one guard recognized Huldar. The guard asked Huldar if he could vouch for the others, and Huldar pointed to Mayvra, offering up, “I *literally* died and she brought me back.” There was just no arguing with that.

The five of you made your way through the gates and into Palebroak - where you soon met an elderly human woman puffing on an unbelievably long-necked pipe. Karna, in particular, clocked a *lot* of agitated folks in the square, all of whom looked like they were struggling to hold *something* back. He asked the woman what had happened, and a well-placed bribe got the woman to open up. Last evening, the reliably secure defenses of Il Ausper were breached. A being of darkness briefly terrorized the city. Karna could see a look of pure panic in the woman’s face - and after regaining her composure, she explained that the Void Whorl beneath Il Ausper had allowed Andel Glass and his colleagues to amplify the scale of some magics - including the Calm Emotions spell currently deployed over the entire city.

You bid the woman a fair evening, and headed to the Dusk Meadow Inn to plan and settle down. Huldar identified the loot you’d obtained - a Periapt of Wound Closure from the Cinder Spire, a sending stone linked presumably to Yuska Rei of the Circle of Six, and a kind of material-attuned de-atomizer of the type that you now know destroyed Wyrfall. As Zaida snoozed, Huldar showed off a - frankly miraculous - new trick, melding scrap metal into a finely crafted glaive for Karna. Then conversation drifted to the Circle of Six. Sameera wondered out loud if her friend Yuska was well. The sending stone returned no response, and when Huldar sent Mia on a recon flight over Old Seocek, she found the location where Sameera *swore* the temple stood … but absent of a temple. By the time Mia was poofed out of her fey existence by a trio of attacking shadow owls, things were looking serious.

So the four woke Zaida to ask her about the Circle of Six. Zaida wordlessly understood the problem of the missing temple, and blessed Huldar, Mayvra, and Karna with a form of Truesight. When you finally arrived at said Temple, it was even worse than you feared. Though edgy Breakwater Guards outside seemed to hardly take notice, inside was the aftermath of a massacre. Wyrfall’s entire Gray Guard was there, all of them killed in what was apparently a valiant attempt to protect the Circle. And they did do their job well - many fiends have been slain. But dead, too, are three Circle members. Thankfully, Sameera’s mother-figure, Yuska Rei, is nowhere to be found. Then suddenly: a gasp. Karna spots a woman, overcome by a terrible, black-tendriled curse. Sameera recognizes this to be Maruna Keen, the Patient. Zaida runs to Marina’s side, tears welling up in her eyes. In her final moments, Maruna conveys what she knows. The leader of this attack has a name: Lo’Thos, The Corrector. Yuska escaped with the aid of what Maruna called “the cape” and headed north. Lo’Thos did not find what they came for. Akio Kiran, Maruna tells them, did his job well. And then Maruna, too, has passed.

After Zaida arranges the dead respectfully, Huldar loots the joint for incense, and the others gather writings of the Six, all of it written in a script like that found in the Cinder Spire. Zaida, for her part, finds a small chapbook-type, hand-drawn atlas, open to a page of a map depicting land just to the west of Il Ausper. A ruin is circled, and beneath it is written a name: Farhaven.

The group returns to the Dusk Meadow Inn and finds rest. After breakfast in the morning, Sameera tries once again to contact Yuska via the Sending Stone. Five seconds. Then 10. Then 20. And finally a response. “Sameera! I do not know if Lo’Thos follows - I barely escaped. They gathered at Farhaven. That’s where they planned the attack - but I cannot be delayed. The Hope of Ioun has returned and I head to them now. You already know where they wait: Evangelion.”

Stunned silence. Out in from the north, bright morning sun fills the room.

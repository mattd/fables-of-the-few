High atop the Penumbra Mountain Range, Mayvra and Zaida sat at the edge of a jagged crevasse of crystalline ice. As Zaida swung her legs in large arcs, back and forth in turn, the two could hear the sound of ice and stone walls collapsing below. “Will we help?” Zaida chirped. Mayvra let out a long, labored sigh - and the two scaled quickly into the void. As Ice Mephits gathered and dove, Huldar blinked out of sight and invisibly charged this golem of elemental cold. Karna’s glaive - and stone-cold game face - stopped a Mephit right where they hovered, giving Sameera the perfect opening to unload a charge with brutal gut-shot accuracy. And then another. And then another. When Huldar struck at the golem, causing Huldar to flicker into view, the creature’s head swiveled, and an ear shattering laser canon of ice struck our Firbolg directly in the chest. Zaida’s voice echoed off the walls as she and Mayvra arrived: “What did we miss?”

The battle was *vicious*. As Mayvra wind-kicked through the crowd, her staff alit with radiant energy, Huldar was struck down, chilled by a second blast of elemental energy. But Karna was able to knock the creatures legs out, and it was Mayvra who got the final blow - an explosion of thunder that shattered its body, the linked Mephits exploding in quick succession soon after.

Zaida sat by Huldar, waiting patiently for him to awaken. And almost immediately after, it was looting time. Huldar maybe literally drooled as he magi-crafted a massive backpack for an even more massive haul of coin. The group also clocked a tourmaline ring or resistance the monster had worn. And glimmering faintly the corner, Mayvra found an uncut diamond, a gem encased within what looked like rough, volcanic stone. It was solid in the hand, and she smiled briefly as she tested its weight.

The five made their way back - Huldar much more slowly - up the crevasse to the Penumbra ridgeline where they all watched Evangelion from a distance as it seemed to slowly morph or transform before them - towers reforming, structures changing. But there was ground left to cover, and they wisely divvied up the heavy spoils to better navigate a long cable bridge, Zaida looking wide eyed as always - “We’re so high!” Then, finally, you were there. On a wide, level ledge most of the way up a tall peak, Evangelion - semi-terrestrial home of the Hope of Ioun - seemed to test out and search for its final form. One part of a tower fanned open, taking the form of a spiral stair that clicked into place. Doors swung open, revealing a sanctuary - and there stood Yuska Rei - the last of the Circle of Six.

Yuska’s reunion with Sameera and Zaida was warm, but Karna sensed a strange vibe - ecstatic, almost unhinged. With their conversation having been limited for some time by the Sending Stone, Sameera took the opportunity to fill in gaps for Yuska. One of those gaps was the deal the five had made with Oglazath to procure the seventh of the Blades of the Silver Sun - and at this Yuska panicked. They really shouldn’t have dealt with Saiviel’s lackeys. But Huldar’s humor calmed her, and soon Yuska lead the group - reverently - inside. It was time to meet the Hope of Ioun.

In a kaleidoscopic sanctuary, slowly but constantly reforming, the Hope was there - High Curator Kwelan Amikye and Curator Veo Doorna. At once, Sameera notices Zaida’s expression freeze, and Mayvra sees an immovable stiffness to the small fey’s stance. The High Curator, at long last and Yuska’s prompting, finally offered a history. Many thousands of years in the past, Nerah found itself caught in a constant cycle of sunrise and sunset. Darkness gripped the world, and the days gave little respite from the relentless terrors of the night. Some in the Age of Many learned to harness the powers of the dark - and they abused these powers mightily. The world seemed beyond saving. The gods turned away, fixing their focus on other, more promising worlds.

Eventually, two archfey rose - a pair bound in a continual chain of death and rebirth. Saiviel Worldkeeper convinced one of the few gods that remained - Avandra, a god of chaos - that Nerah required drastic measures. The archfey asked Avandra to leave this task of building a better Nerah to them, and a deal was struck. The god would sunder nearly everything, and stop the world’s rotation. Saiviel, for their part, would watch over a chosen Few as they slept - and usher those that remained into a new world on waking. But something went wrong. The darkness somehow held fast - and holds fast today. This darkness is, in fact, a danger to *everything*. The attention of the gods begins to turn back to Nerah. Ioun, The Knowing Mother, will return and learn the history of the few. The darkness shall not spread. All worlds will be saved.

Curator Doorna turned to Zaida, knowingly touching her face. Huldar sidled forward - promising drastic action of his own if the Curators made any kind of move on Zaida - and suddenly the room was all tension. But as Doorna explained, Zaida, as the bearer of the Graft of Briccriu is now inseparable from Nerah’s historical record. And now Yuska - near panic after watching this meeting drift sideways - tried to explain. There was no stopping it, no choice in the matter, no rescue. Karna, for his part, offered the seventh Blade - an errand, an exchange. And Yuska searched for a way to reconcile. Evangelion was not ready, she said. More time was needed - and the hour was late. Let them stay, Yuska asked the Curator. We’ll find a way through in the morning.

The Curators agreed and ascended, floating off to some unseen chamber. The five troubled heroes were lead below, down stairs that formed like minute clockwork right before them. Beds circled a smooth dome, which Zaida touched - revealing a twisting cosmos. Starlight lit her face as the others looked on. Finally, quietly, Zaida whispered: “I’m in trouble.”

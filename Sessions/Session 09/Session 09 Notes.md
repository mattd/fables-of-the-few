	- None! Good luck!
- Post Session
	- Feet dangling over the edge, ice cracking. Mayvra sighed, Zaida jumped in.
	- Huldar vanished, Bless. Karna charges in, smashed by a massive ray of arcane frost.
	- Hit by the Mephits, Sameera’s arrow strikes true in golem’s gut, over and over.
	- Mayvra and Zaida land, (What did we miss?) Mayvra calling on the Storm Lord to jut deftly between her foes, burning staff in hand.
	- Spiritual weapon, then Huldar taking a second frost ray to the chest, knocking him unconscious.
	- Karna knocking it to the ground, then Mayvra’s thunderwave blasting it into a million pieces.
	- Zaida waits by Huldar until he wakes.
	- They gather gold, and the ring. Huldar practically drooling and forging a sturdy bag that he wears as a large pack.
	- Mayvra finds an uncut diamond, covered in craggy stone, it’s glimmering insides barely peeking out. Tosses Topaz to Huldar.
	- Climb to top, see Evangelion, which appears to be transforming.
	- Reach the cable bridge, split up the loot. Zaida “we’re so high”, arms barely able to stretch the cable’s width.
	- Clear the bend, see the extent to which Evangelion has transformed, appears to be searching for the correct form.
	- Stairs click into place, Yuska is there, greets Sameera - but Karna clocks that she’s … ecstatic, almost unhinged. Sameera tells her of the seventh Blade of the Silver Sun, Yuska looks panicked, but Huldar calms her down.
	- Yuska brings them in, meet the Curators, Sameera sees Zaida’s face freeze. Mayvra sees her body tense.
	- Weird backwards voice, Yuska argues that they are owed an explanation. He lore dumps.
	- The other Curator touches Zaida who tries to pull away and Huldar is *immediately* on her. “How dare you," the curator warns in a child-like voice. The others inch up.
	- She kneels back down, see dialogue.
	- Discussion about gods and how close Ioun is - they know nothing of gods. Huldar and Mayvra show their understanding.
	- There’s no getting bast this.
	- Panicking more, Yuska brokers a detente - Evangelion is not ready to leave. They will stay the night. Curator reassets that Zaida will *not* leave - and Mayvra speaks up in agreement, as she lifts Zaida up to her shoulders.
	- Go down into the hold. “I’m in trouble.”

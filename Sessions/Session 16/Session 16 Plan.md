    - Recap
        - Huldar, Mayvra, Karna, and Sameera stood in a chamber near the top of the Myceloid stronghold known as Sentience, looking out a window like an organic eye that gazed on the Midsommar Lands far below. Kneeling in front of them was Jin Lunai, member of the Conventicle of the First World. While trying to rescue Brinni Stonesoul, the Conventicle’s leader, Jin was - like Mayvra - infected by Myceloid spores. Now, in front of the group, her body was falling apart - granted a last handful of minutes through the gift of Huldar’s healing touch, which he feels at this moment as the touch of Torag themself. Mayvra _especially_ feels a connection to Jin - and as Mayvra gathers her thoughts, she is attuned to the rise and fall of her own chest. Her breath is tied to this place, the building also imperceptibly breathing.
        - Jin explains that she and other members of the Conventicle failed to understand an important fact. In his current form, the Archdruid Oristivius Quan has - shall we say - ways of surviving. Sentience _itself_ must be convinced to let go of him. And even then - it’s unclear how to capture Quan - a being that claims he can never be bound. The group learns also the amount of time Mayvra has - a day, or perhaps a bit more. Jin’s body crumples - dying - and falls away, and nestled in the remains is something half formed - strangely, not quite a myceloid, but a new form that is very much like one. Huldar conjures a righteous, spectral, holy spear of energy - at first, to divine the true nature of this creature. But this was also - by mechanic - an attack, and that spear _may_ have killed this barely formed child if it had hit, and who knows how Mayvra would have reacted. Fortunately, the little guy scurried with unbelievable speed up a set of uneven, boney stairs to relative safety.
        - As the others surveyed the room, they found that it was covered by large, opaque, blister-like pods filled with treasure. Mayvra reached for a wall, and immediately, she went rigid. A voice, speaking in common, mocked her and her friends. This, was the Archdruid Oristivius Quan. But Mayvra, in her anxious wisdom, heard something _behind_ that voice. A long, drawn out plea for help from Sentience itself. And suddenly, there was another reason to finish this challenge. The group was here for the Seventh Blade of the Silver Sun, they were here for Pref, and they were here for a kind of justice that wouldn’t destroy Mayvra in the process. Oh - and about that Blade - the reason that the group had found Pref, the deal they made with Oglazath to retrieve Sameera from the Astral Sea. In hushed tones, hardly noticed by the others, Sameera and Karna came to a realization. That item that ties this group to Oglazath, and that Quan may indeed hold - this Blade is tied to both Karna and Sameera’s recent past. This Blade helped start more than one person’s journey.
        - Choosing to pass up the treasure kept in these blistered walls, Huldar conjured Mia - who, we neglected to notice, had the look of a creature very subtly evolved - and sent her to the floor above. Mia found a strange museum of a room - with what appeared to be an acceptable level of monster risk - creeping fungal vines, and more of those blindheims with the headlight eyes. Simple. No problem. After they briefly considered letting Sameera scout ahead, the group charged in, all for one - but with Zaida nearly crumbling in a kind of grief, clinging to the thick soft fur on Mayvra’s back, sobbing quietly. And as it turned out, the fight here wasn’t quite so simple. Pref took a righteous beating from the vines - and an absolutely _berserk_ blindheim opened an artery on Sameera’s leg, dropping her to the ground, unconscious.
        - With death in the air, Huldar inexplicably hulked out and rushed to Sameera’s side. And when it was over, Karna tended to Pref. “I didn’t have a plan,” Pref admitted once again. But Karna seemed unbothered. After all, neither had they. Ever, really. Pref let out a single huff of a laugh and popped his shoulder into place. Huldar and Sameera admired the many and varied relics here - tools that all could tell carried strong enchantments. The desire to hold them was strong - but just at that moment, whatever was above them spoke to Mayvra. The group had respected this space - and grudgingly, from some backwards sense of honor, Quan offered an audience in his twisted court. And as Mayvra shares what Quan conveyed, Karna pulled Pref to his feet - and just like that, right away, Pref is heading for the winding stair, fully intending to climb these final stairs, following them ever higher.

    - Session Start
        - Let’s re-orient ourselves for a moment.
        - You all are _far_ above the surface of the Midsommar Lands. It’s evening, but the sun does not fully set in this world. The warm sun that fills this room is made diffuse by the slight opacity of the windows through which it pours - organic lenses that this tower seems to have … grown.
        - The walls - like a thick, cracked exo-skeleton with sinewy purple muscle beneath - here in this room, they fade from a bone grey with a violet hue near the floor, to a lighter shade with an almost pearlescent sheen near the ceiling.
        - Around you: great, great treasure. Weapons of immeasurable power. For Huldar, there is a _pull_. Huldar, you can’t help but think of Thenolin at this moment - her forge in Il Ausper. It feels a million miles away.
        - Sameera, you are just at this moment being pulled to your feet by Karna, the knuckles of his rough, aging hands popping loudly.
        - Mayvra, Zaida has been crying into the back of your neck so steadily that your thick fur, usually providing some solid semblance of protection from the weather … your neck is thoroughly wet.
        - Zaida arches her neck around near your right ear. “Sentience will want to keep you. And the fey will know what I am.”
        - Pref Patar, lanky harengon ranger, his long ears standing almost fully alert - something you didn’t even know they could really do - doesn’t seem to be paying attention to any of you - and he begins to bound resolutely up the bone stairs.
        - His movements are jumpy, like a live wire. But also resolute, determined. Ready to take on a literal arch-fey. His back is to you, and he’s about to turn up a curve in the stairs, out of your line of sight.
        - What do you do?
    - Scenes
        - Upon entering Quan’s self-fashioned throne room, the party finds the Archdruid locked to Sentience, controlling two shadows that stand guard, and keeping watch over Brinni Stonesoul.
        - Zaida warns the group before revealing herself as the bearer of the Graft of Briccriu and the embodiment of the Dawn Chronicle.
        - Quan offers a trade, weighing the value of all he holds against the worth of a world’s history that stands in front of him.
        - The party battles Quan, and finds that his link to Sentience ensures his continued survival.
        - Mayvra meets Sentience - and confronts a choice that may change the trajectory of her life.
        - Wanting to end Quan’s authoritarian hold, Sentience offers to break all bonds with Quan and the hive - but only if Mayvra agrees to metamorphosis and the Bond.
        - The party finds a rose crystal orb containing one casting of the Imprisonment ritual among Quan’s treasure.
        - The party either dispatches or captures Oristivius Quan and must choose to deliver him to the Sombrewood - or to head directly for Saiviel.
    - Secrets & Clues
        - The Archdruid Oristivius Quan does, in fact, hold the seventh Blade of the Silver Sun - buried in a cavity in his chest that’s filled with myceloid flesh.
        - Archdruid Quan recognizes Zaida for what she is - bearer of the Graft of Briccriu, and keeper of the gift
        - Archdruid Quan obtained the seventh Blade from a woman named Brinni Stonesoul - who, in turn, had purchased it for a large sum from Fynn and Karna’s employer.
        - Brinni Stonesoul is the leader of a group called the Conventicle of the First World - a cult based out of Cay Abrill, three days northwest of the Myceloid Wastes.
        - Archdruid Quan didn’t just take the blade of the Silver Sun - he took Brinni herself and currently holds her in myceloid stasis, believing the Conventicle has discovered a deep truth.
        - The cultists are close friends of Sameera’s mother, Meerabai - who lives with the First World Conventicle in Cay Abrill.
        - The Conventicle of the First World has no use for the seventh Blade - instead, they seek leverage over Saiviel, believing they could deliver Nerah “back to the beginning”.
        - In the mess of his sizable collection, Archdruid Quan has lost track of an at-first unassuming rose quartz sphere imbued with a casting of the Imprisonment ritual.
        - Archdruid Quan’s Imprisonment Orb is etched around its circumference with an incantation, written in Draconic, which must be chanted to activate the spell.
        - Archdruid Quan is able to control the myceloids by exploiting a link Sentience shares with her children.
        - Though it thinks and acts on a scale misunderstood by most mortals, Sentience may be convinced to sever the link she shares with her children.
        - Saiviel’s allies now know something that the Curators do not - Saiviel Second-Of-The-Name is dying, much sooner than was foretold.

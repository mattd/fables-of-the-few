Pref Patar, Harengon Ranger, member of the Dawn Walkers, charged with delivering the Archdruid Oristivius Quan to his prison on the Shadow Plane via a portal in the Sombrewood, strode with purpose up the boney, chitinous stairs of Sentience, living home of the myceloids. Karna, Sameera, Mayvra, and Huldar paused to consider their options - but certain aspects of their future felt inescapable. A web of decisions, fate, and blind luck have informed their position and their goals. Oglazath’s curse that requires pursuit of a key-like Blade. Sameera and Karna’s history with said blade, Zaida’s fusion with a strange orb at the beginning of all things, this infection that grows inside Mayvra - tying her to the myceloids. And right in the middle of all of these tethers, there was Zaida’s whispered warning to Mayvra before the party charged behind Pref up those stairs - “Sentience will want to keep you. And the fey will know what I am.”

So, then, here he was before you: the Archdruid Quan, sitting atop a fetid throne, bloomed and decayed a thousand times over. Quan, a high fey, not of this world, appeared fused to his seat, covered in fungal growth, his eyes clouded over. Ribbon-like shadow spirits flanked him, and a shakey looking but enthralled myceloid stood guard. Covered in a thick membranous pod on the floor - and quite unconscious - was the woman Jin Lunai and her cohort had come to save: Brinni Stonesoul, leader of the Conventicle of the First World. Though Quan claimed respect for this strange band before him - freely offering his consideration - it was clear the fey ultimately had very little he cared to hand over. Huldar, for his part, went right for the juice. The four of you were here for the Blade - and as Huldar Minor Imaged up a simple facsimile, Quan’s attention fully focused on this chamber for the first time. The Archdruid mused aloud: everyone seeks that which the Collector is least likely to release. Huldar, Quan informs all of you, will *not* be able to reach the Blade without great effort.

Then, stepping forward, Karna spoke. Karna’s play felt, at that moment, like the best offer the group had: cut this deal (though for what *precisely* Karna remained non-commital) and your group would actively dissuade anyone from making incursions on Quan’s domain. There *was* a kernel of logic to it - but the being that Karna figured the Archdruid was least eager to confront … that’s exactly who Quan most wants to draw forth: Saiviel Second-Of-The-Name, Keeper of Worlds. At this admission, Mayvra, quietly hanging to the side, can’t keep her disdain hidden. As *if* Quan could stand against Saiviel. But that’s the point - in his mind, Quan is *preparing* for that meeting with Saiviel. And he sees his preparations as nearly complete.

Suddenly, Quan paused. He had seen something fleeting. Zaida’s porcelain white skin - Mayvra failing to fully hide the smaller fey where Zaida clung to her back. It was okay, Zaida said. This was something Quan could work with - something truly worthy of his attention. Sister, Quan called Zaida. Bearer of the Graft of Briccriu, the Dawn Chronicle itself taken form. Karna and Huldar strode in front of Zaida. And as a last ditch grab at an upper hand, Huldar attempted a feint. Sure, he’d hand her over - and just leave. And showily, with great weight, Huldar did. But when he was out of sight on the floor below, Huldar grabbed a rune-carved Guisarne, and unfortunately triggering an alarmed trap of sorts - a long, twisting cat with more toe beans than you can count slithered out of a sudden cloud of hazy aether.

And poof, everything fell apart, quickly. A marble of pure dark expanded from Quan’s palm, enveloping the entire room. With Huldar out of reach, a hectic scrabble unfolded. Missed shots, snuffed spells, hard hits. There was a muffled groan in the darkness as Pref fell, ribbons of shadow pulling out what remained of his soul. And there was Karna reaching for Zaida. He was able to hold true for a moment - but then Zaida was airborne, screaming, out of reach as Sameera scurried up the pocked wall in pursuit. As Huldar charged in, shield alit with Torag's light, the darkness spell Quan had cast dissipated. But Quan raised his extended hand, and Zaida shot towards the ceiling, a kind of smooth chrysalis knitting around her, slammed into the ceiling. Her palm pounded on the barrier that held her - and then stilled.

Karna called out for aid - to anyone - and in time, when this is over, and he has time to process, Karna might be amazed to learn what responded. The myceloid, shaken free of its thrall, slammed itself into the feline poracha, momentum carrying it through a chitinous port that had opened moments ago. A musky, musty breeze blew forth, and Mayvra turned in its direction. As Karna and Sameera began to pummel Quan in earnest, Mayvra took the opening. Sentience lay beyond that open door. She needed only walk through and prepare to meet an incomprehensible being ready to ask for nothing less than Mayvra’s whole world.

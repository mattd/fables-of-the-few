Finally, it came to this. Mayvra stood before the visage of Sentience, a golden pearl of continual death and hard-won rebirth. Just feet away in the adjacent chamber, Sameera, Karna, and Huldar clashed with the Archdruid Quan. But here, Mayvra moved with intention through spore-clouded air, encouraged by a myceloid “brother”, noticing the common ground they share beyond language. Face to face, knowing this erupting bloom is the source of what grows inside her, Mayvra may have discovered that the link she shares with Sentience opens some sort of path or line that could help her trace the shape of her half-remembered life. Sentience has come to know her. And Mayvra is more than Sentience could have asked for. For Mayvra, confronted by this ancient entity who has known a nearly literal eternity, what’s important is laid bare - her mortal friends. Mayvra has known them mere weeks, but they *matter* to her. Is it possible for Mayvra to save them? Sentience concedes - there may very well be a way.

But in that other chamber, the struggle against Quan feels near to a dark turn. Perhaps out of a belief that Quan could still be slain swiftly, Huldar uttered a blessing for his friends - weighing offensive action over health and survival. The Archdruid sneered through a self-assured screed as Sameera launched volley after volley. Quan was a pincushion, but the shadowy death ribbons under his control were far harder to hit. (And though defense is never quite as exciting, the trio’s ability to evade at these moments may have actually saved lives.) What’s more, Karna caught - for the first time - a literal glimmer of hope. Something slender but substantial was hidden deep in Quan’s chest.

At that very moment, in the other chamber, Mayvra became aware of the choice before her - its shape, its size, and its weight. Quan can be defeated - but only if Sentience severs the tie that binds them to their children, scattering the hive, and ending a reign that has lasted millennia. Quan, she learned, exploits that bond. Without it, he has nothing. Yet, no matter what Sentience *wants*, Sentience is incapable of sacrifice. She is beholden to her nature. Sentience is duty bound to survive. And *there* lies the solution. If Mayvra will carry Sentience - if she will consent to *become* them, dropping her own form for something unknown and altogether new. The courage and purity of Mayvra’s sacrifice may, in fact, be at least partially lost on her. To Mayvra, it may have felt like moments of consideration passed. But to any one of her friends, her internal world would have registered as but a scant handful of moments. Mayvra thought simply of all that she had failed to save. She could do better *this* time.

And just like that, the decision was made. Tethers pulled from the walls, readying for an embrace. A lichen-esque chest bloomed next to her, revealing an orb Sentience says may contain what’s left of Quan. But that’s just an operational detail. Now, in this moment, Sentience is unspeakably proud of what Mayvra has done. As fungal tethers wrap Mayvra, pulling her close, she is aware that this is over. This is done. Something new has begun. Mayvra lets go and her form scatters as spores, leaving a nascent but swiftly growing, huamnoid form, cradled by an umbilical mass, lowered quickly to the floor.

Though he didn’t yet know the gravity of what had just occurred, Quan would soon. His body - more myceloid than fey - quickly gave way. There was no deal to be had now, but Quan reached for it. There was no sense in mocking Sameera, his distant fey kin, but he did. This was all set in stark contrast to Huldar’s whispered prayer of healing, surging out from him in all directions, healing the living and scattering Quan’s shadows. And Karna, for his part, seized a chance to take whatever Quan had buried deep in his chest. Right away he knew it, the moment his fingers touched it - the seventh Blade of the Silver Sun. Tearing it free was enough to end Quan, who fell as a dissolving, viscous mass to the floor.

Things moved quickly. Zaida and Brinni Stooesoul, leader of the Conventicle of the First World were freed as the pods that contained them gave way, Karna catching Zaida tenderly when she fell. Pref marveled at the turn, lifting himself up to seated, once again conscious. And Huldar searched for Mayvra, finding the Myceloid that had joined them, watching the final stages of her transformation. Mustering all his will, they confirmed this was indeed Mayvra that they held now - and Huldar may have quickly understood the scope of what had happened.

As the tower, Sentience’s former body, fell to pieces, the group fled - quickly gathering as much of Quan’s collection as they could carry. They hurried into the softening dusk light of the Myceloid Wastes with more inhabitants of the tower, undiscovered until only moments ago. At a safe distance, they watched the tower fall. Zaida and Mayvra - along with Brinni, still an unknown to them all - all three had yet to awake. But they were safe - and to those that considered the tower’s wreckage against the dropping sun, the future felt that much more open.

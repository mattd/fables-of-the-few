	- “No thanks. I’m good!”
	- Meerabai.
	- “Need help? Searching for last blade. Zaida and three others.”
	- “Zaida Safe? Please, please keep her that way. Join us. Where the penumbra turns east, Evangelion is there. The Blades matter more than you know. Last? That can’t be good.”
	- Mayvra: “Okay, I’m ready.”
	- Huldar uses spiritual weapon - mace, little bit more hefty.
	- “Destiny. Remember.”
- Post Session
	- Started with Sameera in the Astral Sea - tried to escape the strange purple breath that surrounded her.
	- Sees ship - when she tries to move out of its path, it tracks towards her.
	- In the Ruins, Oglazath attempts to strike a deal. Draws a symbol in the air. [See read-in.]
	- Karna offers a blood offering. No - this will be on Oglazath’s terms.
	- Oglazath explains to Huldar - who seems concerned - that this is a curse of sorts.
	- Zaida, hand on hilt.
	- Explains that the curse requires them to maintain their pursuit of the Blade of the Silver Sun.
	- Huldar loots the body, takes two shards of dark black material that seems to absorb light.
	- Oglazath offers up some explanations. [See Oglazath’s talking points. Add in that he is not interested in the Graft of Briccriu.]
	- Oglazath tells each of the group that they too must accept the curse.
	- Huldar asks about this place. [See Secrets and Clues.]
	- When talking about the Nightstone, Oglazath adds a sweetener - he’ll get them out without getting caught.
	- The group decides they need to chat it through.
	- Karna sees no other way.
	- Mayvra asks Zaida what she thinks. Her duty, she explains, has always been to protect the Graft.
	- Everyone agrees.
	- Gets Oglazath’s attention.
	- Flash back to Sameera, ship approaches. Out of the top through a portal like a throat emerges an illithid. Speaks to her: Astral Elf - your kind has not been seen here for thousands upon thousands of years. Come with us.
	- “No thanks. I’m good!” BAMF.
	- With a wave of his hand, Oglazath brings Sameera back to the Prime Material.
	- Explains what her cohort has agreed to.
	- Pushes glyph into each of them. A great heat, though not unberable - and then nothing.
	- The plan is to return to their camp.
	- Huldar worgs into Mia, flies around Farhaven and clocks two Trog sentries heading into an entrance on the upper most level.
	- The group makes to leave, someone has heard them. Oglazath creates a duplicate of himself.
	- Group leaves his lifeless body - then realizes there are unanswered questions - where is the blade? Karna retrieves him.
	- On their way out, the group is heard by one of the Trog sentries - Sameera looses a single arrow, hits the back of his neck as a he flees, drops him from 200 feet.
	- Manage to get back to the cover of the deep brush.
	- Talk with Oglazath more when he awakes, having dropped his duplicate. Tells group of the location of the Adjuration Flare - three weeks, take it there.
	- Tracked it to Meerabai, but never found her. - doesn’t know if she’s alive, only that the next holder was headed for Oachud, but then the trail went dead.
	- If they fulfill their duty - or if anyone else beats them to it - the curse is off.
	- Oglazath leaves.
	- Group calls Yuska. See above notes for each direction.
	- Heads out without a long rest. Gets to their boat, heads across the river, avoids Delg’s Annex, which Sameera has heard is abandoned but rumored to be overrun by some legion-like entity.
	- See a shimmering fog over parts of the town - it blows away in the breeze, but then re-collects.
	- Pass by, head north, see Penumbra range with its icy peaks and perpetual dry, electric clouds.
	- In the plains, a crater. Karna and Huldar approach, Mia circles. Karna and Huldar within 30 feet. Huldar sends Mia down - poof.
	- Mayvra hears a familiar voice. [See notes.]
	- “I’m ready.”
	- Electric energy gathers, builds - and takes on a monstrous shape.
	- Huldar conjures Spiritual Weapon, chonkier mace, misses with a Sacred Flame.
	- Mayvra bonfire, hits.
	- It balls up, flies at Karna - who attempts to hit it, but misses.
	- Lashes out, massive damage. Karna’s resolve to work through the pain, reviving HP.
	- Zaida hits with arrow, not as much damage as she expected.
	- Sameera, with Karna engaged, hits with a devastating hit - but again, not much damage.
	- Energy forms into a vaporous, ghostly appxoximation of a face, pulses at Mayvra.
	- “Destiny. Remember.”

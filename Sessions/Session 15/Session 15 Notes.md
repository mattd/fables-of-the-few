- Post Session
	- Huldar’s holy feeling.
	- They talk with Jin, she describes what she knows.
	- Huldar asks about how long Mayva has. A day, no more.
	- Jin dies, becomes a leshi.
	- Huldar divine lances the thing, it runs.
	- Mayvra feels the connection with Sentience, hears from Quan and something beneath.
	- Karna and Sameera discuss the seventh Blade of the Silver Sun.
	- Sameera bites it, Huldar buffs out, she stabilizes.
	- Karna battle medics Pref.
	- Zaida is crying the whole time.
	- Session ended with Pref “I never had a plan.” Karna: “It’s okay. We’ve never really had one either.” Pref huffs a single “heh,” pops his shoulder into place. Karna pulls him to his feet - and Pref makes for the stairs.

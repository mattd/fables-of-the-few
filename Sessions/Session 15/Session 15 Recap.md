Huldar, Mayvra, Karna, and Sameera stood in a chamber near the top of the Myceloid stronghold known as Sentience, looking out a window like an organic eye that gazed on the Midsommar Lands far below. Kneeling in front of them was Jin Lunai, member of the Conventicle of the First World. While trying to rescue Brinni Stonesoul, the Conventicle’s leader, Jin was - like Mayvra - infected by Myceloid spores. Now, in front of the group, her body was falling apart - granted a last handful of minutes through the gift of Huldar’s healing touch, which he feels at this moment as the touch of Torag themself. Mayvra *especially* feels a connection to Jin - and as Mayvra gathers her thoughts, she is attuned to the rise and fall of her own chest. Her breath is tied to this place, the building also imperceptibly breathing.

Jin explains that she and other members of the Conventicle failed to understand an important fact. In his current form, the Archdruid Oristivius Quan has - shall we say - ways of surviving. Sentience *itself* must be convinced to let go of him. And even then - it’s unclear how to capture Quan - a being that claims he can never be bound. The group learns also the amount of time Mayvra has - a day, or perhaps a bit more. Jin’s body crumples - dying - and falls away, and nestled in the remains is something half formed - strangely, not quite a myceloid, but a new form that is very much like one. Huldar conjures a righteous, spectral, holy spear of energy - at first, to divine the true nature of this creature. But this was also - by mechanic - an attack, and that spear *may* have killed this barely formed child if it had hit, and who knows how Mayvra would have reacted. Fortunately, the little guy scurried with unbelievable speed up a set of uneven, boney stairs to relative safety.

As the others surveyed the room, they found that it was covered by large, opaque, blister-like pods filled with treasure. Mayvra reached for a wall, and immediately, she went rigid. A voice, speaking in common, mocked her and her friends. This, was the Archdruid Oristivius Quan. But Mayvra, in her anxious wisdom, heard something *behind* that voice. A long, drawn out plea for help from Sentience itself. And suddenly, there was another reason to finish this challenge. The group was here for the Seventh Blade of the Silver Sun, they were here for Pref, and they were here for a kind of justice that wouldn’t destroy Mayvra in the process. Oh - and about that Blade - the reason that the group had found Pref, the deal they made with Oglazath to retrieve Sameera from the Astral Sea. In hushed tones, hardly noticed by the others, Sameera and Karna came to a realization. That item that ties this group to Oglazath, and that Quan may indeed hold - this Blade is tied to both Karna and Sameera’s recent past. This Blade helped start more than one person’s journey.

Choosing to pass up the treasure kept in these blistered walls, Huldar conjured Mia - who, we neglected to mention, had the look of a creature very subtly evolved - and sent her to the floor above. Mia found a strange museum of a room - with what appeared to be an acceptable level of monster risk - creeping fungal vines and more of those blindheims with the headlight eyes. Simple. No problem. After they briefly considered letting Sameera scout ahead, the group charged in, all for one - but with Zaida nearly crumbling in a kind of grief, clinging to the thick soft fur on Mayvra’s back, sobbing quietly. And as it turned out, the fight here wasn’t quite so simple. Pref took a righteous beating from the vines - and an absolutely *berserk* blindheim opened an artery on Sameera’s leg, dropping her to the ground, unconscious.

With death in the air, Huldar inexplicably hulked out and rushed to Sameera’s side. And when it was over, Karna tended to Pref. “I didn’t have a plan,” Pref admitted once again. But Karna seemed unbothered. After all, neither had they. Ever, really. Pref let out a single huff of a laugh and popped his shoulder into place. Huldar and Sameera admired the many and varied relics here - tools that all could tell carried strong enchantments. The desire to hold them was strong - but just at that moment, whatever was above them spoke to Mayvra. The group had respected this space - and grudgingly, from some backwards sense of honor, Quan offered an audience in his twisted court. And as Mayvra shares what Quan conveyed, Karna pulled Pref to his feet - and just like that, right away, Pref is heading for the winding stair, fully intending to climb these final stairs, following them ever higher.
